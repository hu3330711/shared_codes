Parameter: 	Integrated particle flux for geocentric satellites 

NSSDC ID:	PT-15A

Brief Description:
The Short Orbital Flux Integration Program (SOFIP) is a computer code that 
has been developed to evaluate the space radiation environment encountered 
by geocentric satellites. It produces for a given input trajectory a 
composite integral orbit spectrum of either protons or electrons. Additional
features include calculation of exposure index, peaks per orbit, percent 
time in electron trapping zones differential spectrum, and solar proton 
fluences (using SOLPRO). SOFIP is a structured, modularized code, which can 
perform all the functions of larger and more complex programs, if the
correct modules are used. Care should be taken to use the correct epoch 
(1965 for solar minimum and 1970 for maximum) for the geomagnetic field in 
the calculation of magnetic field strength B and L-value. B/Bo and L are 
needed to determine trapped particle fluxes with the help of the electron (AE)
and proton (AP) models. Otherwise, erroneous fluxes may result at low 
altitudes. The code includes the following software files as provided 
by the model author: SOFIP.FOR is the FORTRAN program file, AE%%%%.DAT
and AP%%%%.DAT are the model maps in form of BLOCKDATA statements.
