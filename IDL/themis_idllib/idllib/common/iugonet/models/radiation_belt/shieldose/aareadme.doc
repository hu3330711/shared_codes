Shieldose is a computer code for space-shielding radiation dose calculations 
developed by S. Seltzer (NIST). The program determines the absorbed dose 
as a function of depth in aluminum shielding material of spacecraft, 
given the electron and proton fluences encountered in orbit.  The code 
makes use of precalculated, mono-energetic depth-dose data for an 
isotropic, broad-beam fluence of radiation incident on uniform aluminum 
plane media. These precalculated values are the result of detailed 
electron and electron-bremsstrahlung Monte Carlo calculations. The present 
version of Shieldose calculates, for arbitrary proton and electron incident 
spectra, the dose absorbed in small volumes of the detector materials Al, 
H2O (tissue-equivalent detector), Si, and SiO2, in the following aluminum 
shield geometries:  (1) in a semi-infinite plane medium, as a function of 
depth; (2) at the transmission surface of a plane slab, as a function of 
slab thickness; and (3) at the center of a solid sphere, as a function of 
sphere radius. The software package consist of two files SHIELDOSE.FOR
and SHIELDOSE.DAT. (NSSDC-ID: PT-16A).
