Parameter:	Exospheric hydrogen density

Brief Description:

A Monte Carlo simulation of the terrestrial hydrogen exosphere is
used to derive a global model of the exospheric hydrogen density.
A third-order spherical harmonic expansion in longitude and colatitude
is used to represent H at a particular radius. The h_exos.dat file
provides the harmonic expansion coefficients for 40 radii (between
6640 km and 62126 km) for solstice and equinox conditions, and for
four levels of solar activity (F10.7 = 80, 130, 180, 230). Details
of the Monte Carlo simulation are explained in Hodges (1994). The
simulation results show significant differences with previous
exosphere models, as well as with the H distributions of the MSIS-86
thermosphere model.
