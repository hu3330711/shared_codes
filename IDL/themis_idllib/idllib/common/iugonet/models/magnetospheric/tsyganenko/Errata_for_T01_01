T01_01 model code corrections/updates:


February 13, 2002. In some cases with abnormally low values of the solar wind
   pressure, the previous version of the model code crashed at low altitudes,
   due to inaccurate scaling of the Birkeland currents. In the corrected version,
   the problem has been eliminated. Courtesy of Dr. Mattias Foerster, (Max-Planck
   Institute, Germany).


May 14, 2002. An update was made of the FUNCTION AP(R,SINT,COST), to eliminate
   possible floating underflows of the variables DEXP1, DEXP2, and DEXP3, becoming
   exponentially small at large geocentric distances.
