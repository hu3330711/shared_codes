Brief description of model:

This package can be used in MATLAB/SIMULINK simulations of spacecraft
motion when a planetary magnetic field model is required.  For example,
it may be necessary to evaluate the torque produced by interaction
of the spacecraft's magnetic moment with the field, or by attitude control
devices such as magnetic dampers and magnetic torquers.  A field model
would also be required in a simulation involving magnetometers or similar
attitude sensors, which operate by measuring the field.

The model is a collection of MATLAB functions that calculate a magnetic
field vector when the field is regarded as a gradient of a potential
function that, in turn, can be described as an infinite series of spherical
harmonics.  Computation of the field vector is performed speedily by means
of recursion formulae, and the calculations do not suffer from the shortcoming
of a singularity when evaluated at points that lie on the polar axis.

Although the MATLAB routine IGRF95.m includes Gauss coefficients for the
1995 International Geomagnetic Reference Field, the user is free to
substitute coefficients from other IGRF model years, or use coefficients
that result from interpolation.  One may even use Gauss coefficients
associated with other celestial bodies or magnets.

Results from these MATLAB routines (reported in the comments of
igrf_example.m) have been compared to those from modified FORTRAN code
(bilcal.for and shellig.for) obtained originally from
ftp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/models/geomagnetic/igrf/ at Goddard's
National Space Science Data Center, and results are identical to 14 decimal
places.  In contrast to the FORTRAN code, the MATLAB routines do not compute
L-value, magnetic inclination and declination angles, and dipole moment, nor
do they provide profiles of the field as a function of altitude, latitude,
longitude, and year.  The production of such profiles can be accomplished
rather easily with MATLAB instructions that make repeated calls to
routines recursion.m and bfield.m; in fact, igrf_example.m produces a profile
taken along a circle.
