	8 files for the solar EUV91 model: 

1) EUV91.DOC (this file),
2) EUV91.TXT (text file which is the same as the JATP journal article), 
3) EUV91COEF.TXT (table of coefficients for the model),
4) EUV91.FOR (FORTRAN 77 code),
5) EUV91.PRO (IDL code),
6) EUV91INDEX1.DAT (data file: date, Lyman-alpha, He I 10,830, F10.7, 
	F10.7 81-day mean values for 47001-68172).
7) EUV91INDEX2.DAT (data file: date, Lyman-alpha, He I 10,830, F10.7, 
	F10.7 81-day mean values for 68173-88366).
8) EUV91INDEX3.DAT (data file: date, Lyman-alpha, He I 10,830, F10.7, 
	F10.7 81-day mean values for 89001-90365).

	The fortran version works identically with the IDL version 
and has been tested on maximum, moderate, and minimum solar condition 
cases (79050, 83138, 86190). The cases of no Lyman-alpha or He I data 
(where F10.7 proxy is substituted, eg 74001) and the case of column change 
for consecutive dates in the index file (78268 to 78269) has also been tested. 
The fortran version generates some floating point underflow errors 
on some occasions (ignore these) when it takes exponents of very small 
numbers (used in the W scaling function). In these cases, the result 
is still valid - i.e. the number "0" is obtained. If these are worrisome 
to the user, the 2 lines of code using this exponentiation in SUBROUTINE 
FLUX "do 20" loop, "W(j) = ..."  can be commented out since W(j) is 
set to 1.0 by default. 

	Single date fluxes or consecutive date fluxes can be generated. 
For each day, a file using that day (in YYDDD format) in the filename is 
created in the default directory. 

	Best wishes for successful modeling using this empirical EUV!

Revision history:
	1) The originally revised SERF2 model was completed on June 6, 1990.
	   The model as it exists in the JATP preprint reflects this 
	   version of the model.
	2) Three minor revisions were incorporated into the model on 
	   April 18, 1991. They are: a) inclusion of the June 20, 1989 LASP 
	   rocket flight data into the model as released by Tom Woods 
	   (private communication); b) elimination of the use of the "W(i)"
	   scaling function and replacement of it by creating a missing 
	   daily value of a proxy with the linear relationship to another 
	   similar solar source region proxy; and c) removal of the 
	   "discontinuity" in chromospheric model values on day 281, 
	   1981 (October 8, 1981) which corresponds to the date that two 
	   proxies (Lyman-alpha and He I 10830) were jointly used in the 
	   model (prior to this date, there was a scaling of He I with the 
	   "W" function). The net effect of these revisions is to change 
	   the coefficients in the table EUV91COEF.TXT. The model was 
	   slightly improved with the elimination of the day 81281 
	   "discontinuity" and slightly different (generally higher) model 
	   flux values from the June 1990 version. The model as it exists 
	   in the JATP published article reflects this version of the model.
	3) Revisions to the EUV91.FOR code for use on PCs include:
		a) all subroutine and variable names 6 characters maximum
		b) machine-dependent default variable declarations used
		c) "if" statements no longer test real-valued equalities 
		d) "do" loops now use labeled "continue" and not "end do"
		e) once the number of coefficients totals 8 from a line read
		   in, the loop is exited in SUBROUTINE RDDATA to avoid 
		   any trailing blank problems.

Dear Colleague,

	The next E-mail message contains the updated table of 
model coefficients for the empirical solar EUV model, EUV91, which 
you have. If you need a new Fortran 77 or IDL version of the model, 
please let me know.

	These coefficients have been slightly revised from the 
published version in JATP (1991). Particularly, the Lyman-beta and 
C III lines have higher absolute intensities than the previous model 
version and will affect E-region ionization modeling. These new model 
results were presented at the fall '91 AGU meeting and a paper summary 
of those results are available if you are interested.

	The FUV irradiances in the model are being developed and 
some preliminary results were shown at AGU. However, these values 
are still being studied for consistency with published data and 
are not yet available for release. Over the next year I hope to 
have several of the important lines and intervals available (eg 
1304) and, additionally, hope to have made improvements in the 
estimation of the soft x-rays based on some new datasets now 
becoming available. 

	Finally, I will be leaving the University of California at 
Berkeley on December 31, 1991 and will be going to JPL to work 
with the Galileo UVS science team on a permanent basis. My mail 
and e-mail addresses will both change. However, e-mail which 
is sent to ZODIAC::TOBISKA will be forwarded to me. 

	Seasons greetings!

	Kent Tobiska

Changes in EUV91COEF.TXT file:

b1 through b4 are set to 0 in this revision (Apr 12 1991)
 
The following intervals and lines have been slightly revised due to
reprocessing of the LASP 1989 data and incorporation of the smaller,
"nonstandard" lines into the wavelength range flux (Sep 4 1991):
     356-400(2), 401-437(2), 453-499(2), 500-550(1,2), 701-750(1),
     750-800(1,2), 801-850(1), 901-950(1), 977(1), 951-1000(1),
     1026(1), 1001-1050(1)
Far UV lines and intervals were added solely based on the SME data.

Several changes were made to produce a version which can run on a
IBM compatible PC.
