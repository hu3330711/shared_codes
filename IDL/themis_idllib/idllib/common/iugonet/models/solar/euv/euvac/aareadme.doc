Brief Description:

EUVAC is a solar EUV flux model for aeronomic calculations
developed by P.G. Richards and colleagues at the University
of Alabama in Huntsville. The model is based on the F74113
solar EUV reference spectrum (see AE-EUV directory). It uses
the F10.7 index for modeling the solar flux variation in the 37
wavelength groups that are most important for aeronomic computations.
Photoelectron fluxes calculated with the EUVAC model and a
set of recommended cross sections agreed well with measured
photoelectron fluxes from AE-E and DE-2. EUVAC is well suited
for aeronomic calculations but is not designed to accurately
predict the solar flux variability for individual lines.
