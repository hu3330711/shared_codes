AURORAL OVAL REPRESENTATION OF THE FELSTEIN OVALS BY HOLZWORTH AND MENG

This model provides a mathematical representation of the auroral oval by a
seven parameter Fourier series. Holzworth and Meng (1975) list coefficients 
for the seven Feldstein (1963) ovals which correspond to different levels of 
geomagnetic activity. The model provides the equatorward and polward 
boundaries in Corrected Geomagnetic Latitude (CGL) of the oval for given 
magnetic local time (MLT); MLT is the magnetic local time in a Corrected
Geomagnetic Coordinate system. The FORTRAN program computes the CGL values 
for given MLT and level of magnetic activity (0 to 6). 

Please note that coordinate conversions from geographic to corrected 
geomagnetic coordinates and vice versa can be done online at

and the conversion software can be retrieved from
