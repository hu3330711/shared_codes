Parameter: 
High-latitude electric potential and field, Pedersen and Hall
conductances, field aligned currents, and Joule heating 

Brief Description:
This software package includes several electric convection field models, 
and the AFGL Precipitation and Conductivity Model; the latter for obtaining 
conductances, currents, and heating. The Heppner-Maynard models are based 
on OGO 6 (Polar-Orbiting Geophysical Observatory 6) and DE 2 (Dynamics 
Explorer 2) electric field measurements and provide the electric potential 
and field poleward of 60 geomagnetic latitude. Seven different models
were generated for different Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) conditions.
Spherical harmonics to order 11 in magnetic local time and latitude are used 
in each case. For southward IMF, an explicit variability with geomagnetic 
activity is included. The Heelis Electric Convection Field Model is included 
in this package for comparative purposes. Rich and Maynard (1989) illustrate 
the improvements of their model in relation to the Heelis model and point out 
the differences to Foster et al. (1986) (cf. the Millstone Hill Electric
Field Model) in the region of the Harang discontinuity and near the dayside
cleft.
