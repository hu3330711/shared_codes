Brief Description:      This directory contains some software tools written
			in the IDL language.  This is a "library" of routines
			useful for reading in data that is stored in the CDF
			format and also for plotting the data variables as
			time series, images, radar, and spectrograms.  
			In order to use this s/w you must have IDL 
			installed on your local machine.  

Software Distribution:  The software files are provided in two ways.
			The source directory contains the individual files.
			The unix directory contains the files in a tar and
			tar/gzip file.

			been compressed using the Gnu "gzip" utility.
