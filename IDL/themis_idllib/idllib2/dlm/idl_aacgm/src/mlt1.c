 Added Author Name

 Revision 1.4  1998/06/17 18:59:41  barnes
 There appeared to be a problem at certain MLT times because the order
 of the spherical harmonic expansion for the coordinate conversion was too
 high.

 Revision 1.3  1998/06/16 23:48:17  barnes
 Fixed bug that caused the interpolated mlt to be wrong.

 Revision 1.2  1998/06/05 20:46:36  barnes
 Modifications to fix problems with return codes.
