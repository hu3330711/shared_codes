; NAME:
;        DEFAULT_CTM
;
; PURPOSE:
;        Define default system variable for CTM data directory.
;        This procedure is caled from DEFAULT_DIRS when 'CTM' is
;        added as an argument.
;
; CATEGORY:
;        Administrative Tools
;
; CALLING SEQUENCE:
;        DEFAULT_CTM,host
;
; INPUTS:
;        HOST -> the name of the host computer which is running IDL.
;            In our environment these are sol or cyclope for now.
;
; KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
;
; OUTPUTS:
;        Additional system variable is created:
;          !CTM_Dir = the root of the file system
;          !CTM_Filetypes = a list of frequently encountered extensions
;
; SUBROUTINES:
;
; REQUIREMENTS:
;        It is assumed that this routine is called from DEFAULT_DIRS
;        although it should be working stand-alone as well.
;
; NOTES:
