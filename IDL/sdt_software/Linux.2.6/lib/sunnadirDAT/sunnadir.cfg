#
#
#      GENERAL INFORMATION
#      -------------------
#
#
#      This is an actual configuration file, but it can be
#      modified as needed.
#
#
#      A configuration file is an ASCII text file, made up of
#      any number of lines.
#
#
#      A configuration file consists of 2 types of lines:
#
#       1) comment lines.
#
#       2) data lines.
#
#
#
#
#      DEFINITIONS: WHITE SPACE, FIELD
#      -------------------------------
#
#
#      "White space" is a string of one or more blank spaces, or
#      one or more tab characters, or any intermixture of the
#      two.
#
#      Within white space, therefore, there cannot be any
#      character that is not a blank space or a tab character.
#
#
#      A "field" is a string of one or more characters within a
#      line, delimited by: white space, and/or the beginning of
#      the line, and/or the end of the line.
#
#      Within a field, therefore, there cannot be any blank
#      space or tab character.
#
#
#      There should not be any non-printable characters within
#      any field.
#
#
#
#
#      COMMENT LINES
#      -------------
#
#
#      A comment line can be any one of the following:
#
#       1) A line whose first character is the "pound" or
#          "number" sign  # , such as this line.
#
#          Any characters (or none) may follow the # character
#          on the line.
#
#       2) A line starting with white space, which is
#          immediately followed by the # character.
#
#          Any characters (or none) may follow the # character
#          on the line.
#
#       3) An empty line, i.e., one that has no characters in
#          it.
#
#       4) A line consisting only of white space.
#
#
#       There is no continuation feature for comment lines.
#       Each line is determined to be a comment line or not on
#       its own, independently of the other lines in the file.
#
#
#       Comment lines are ignored when the file is processed;
#       therefore, they can be inserted wherever one wants.
#
#
#
#
#      DATA LINES
#      ----------
#
#
#      Any line that is not a comment line is considered to be a
#      data line, and must conform to the proper format for data
#      lines.
#
#
#      Each data line specifies one single value to be used.
#
#
#      Every data line must contain a minimum of 2 fields.
#
#
#
#      Data lines - field 1
#      --------------------
#
#
#      The first field is a label, to indicate the type of value
#      specified in the line.
#
#
#      It is ESSENTIAL that the label be correct, as any
#      unrecognized label is illegal.
#
#
#
#      Data lines - field 2
#      --------------------
#
#
#      The second field is the actual value being provided.
#
#
#      An optional leading + sign is permitted for non-negative
#      values.
#
#
#      Since the value is one single field, if there is an
#      algebraic sign (+ or -), it must be immediately adjacent
#      to the number, with no white space in between.
#
#
#      For real values, an optional decimal point and fraction
#      are permitted.
#
#
#
#      Data lines - fields 3 and beyond
#      --------------------------------
#
#
#      Any fields beyond field 2 are ignored, and can be used as
#      comments if desired.
#
#      Example:
#        label      value   *** this value for 8/94 - 2/95
#
#
#
#      Order of data lines, and defaults
#      ---------------------------------
#
#
#      Data lines can be in any order.
#
#
#      Note that if more than one data line for a particular
#      type of value is present, the value that is used is the
#      one from the last such line.
#
#      Therefore, an alternative to changing the values in the
#      file is to add more lines.
#
#      Example:
#        label      value1   *** this value for 8/94 - 2/95
#        label      value2   *** this value for 3/95 - 11/95
#
#      In this example, the value used will be "value2".
#
#
#      It must be noted that all data lines are processed, and
#      therefore, a data line with illegal contents can cause
#      the program to fail even if the line is superseded by a
#      later data line for the same type of value.
#
#
#      For any type of value for which no data line is present
#      at all, a default value is used.
#
#      The default values are set elsewhere, not in this file.
#
#      It is recommended, however, that for every type of value,
#      a data line be present and so a value be specified
#      explicitly; even if the value is the same as the default
#      value.

#      Type of value :  Duration for the ephemeris computation.

#      Data type :  Real
#      Units :  Seconds
#      Default value :  200
#      Allowable range :  1 through 600
#      Note :  Although the value is read in as real, it is
#              rounded immediately to the nearest integer value,
#              and it is this integer value that is actually
#              used.  This is because no fraction of a second
#              for this value is sent to the spacecraft.

#      Note :  The maximum is set so as not to exceed either the
#              instrument software limit or the size limit for
#              CCSDS packets.
#              The actual number of elements used may be smaller
#              than the number requested, if otherwise the
#              number of elements would cause the table to cover
#              more than the complete orbital period.

#      Allowable range :  any value
#      Note :  The angle can be specified in the interval from
