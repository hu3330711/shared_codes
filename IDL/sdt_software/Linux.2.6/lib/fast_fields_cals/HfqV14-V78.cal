7			Type: HFQ.
sec			x-axis units.
Degrees			y-axis units.
xx			z-axis units.
0			Boomlength index.
0			Gain state.
0			History.
# Calibrations derived from WPC phase calibration diferences.
# The gains are all set to same value. HFQ phase differences fit to
# third order polynomial. A negative phase indicates the first pair
# lags the second pair.
