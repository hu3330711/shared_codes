Dsp_V5-V7		Data Name
11			Type:  Dsp
sec			x-axis units
kHz			y-axis units
(V/m)^2/Hz		z-axis units
18			Boomlength index
0			No gain state
0			History
#
# The Dsp removes the offset, so it is always zero.
# Dsp Gain = (Corresponding 16-bit ADC gain) ^2 * 1.678x10^9 / 10^6. 
# ADC gain in mV/bit. 
# Dsp is evaluated by SDT to range from -96 to 0 in dB.
# Dsp calibration: 10^(DSP/10) * Dsp Gain / Boomlength^2 / Bandwidth.
# Amplitude vs frequency is renormalized with amplitude array.
# Frequecies in amplitude array are in kHz!
# See corresponding file, FPA_xxx.cal for details on FPA.
