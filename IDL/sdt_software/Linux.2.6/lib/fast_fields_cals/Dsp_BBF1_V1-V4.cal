# Calibration table as of 6/7/95.
# Calibration set for 400 kHz input frequency. 
# Linear calibration on decompressed output.
# Output in mV/m 1/2 Vpp.
# Since data collected requires only 12 bits, there will be little 
# discrepency in data between frequency domains, so BBF files are 
# identical for two given spheres.
# The Dsp removes the offset, so it is always zero.
# To find the gain, scale the ADC value by 32.28.  This value was found by
# comparing ADC bits to (Dsp bits)^1/2.  The exponent is present since the
# Dsp goes as power, <Gain>^2.  Thus, gain is simply:  Dsp gain =
# (ADC gain)/ 32.28, and has units mV (or V)/(Dsp bit)^1/2.
