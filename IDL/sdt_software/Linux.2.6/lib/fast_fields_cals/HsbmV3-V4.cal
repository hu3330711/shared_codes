# Calibration table as of 7/25/95.
# The computer HSBM data was stripped into an ASCII file, and then the long-
# est stretch of continuous data was plotted, and fit to an offset sine 
# wave:  Asin(fx + K) + B, where f is angular frequency, x is time, K is
# phase, A is amplitude and B is offset.
# Phase K constrained to between 0 and 2*pi, and difference calculated with
# V1-V2 as the baseline.
# Gain is calculated as:  (1000)(0.5)/(gain bits) mV.
# "Gain" and "Offset" entries taken from 100kHz data at 500 kHz Nyquist.
# In the table below, the Nyquist frequency is 125 kHz for the first group, 
# of data, 500 kHz for the second group and 1 MHz for the third group.
#
# Poles added 11/15/96 by REE to fix phase between E and B.
