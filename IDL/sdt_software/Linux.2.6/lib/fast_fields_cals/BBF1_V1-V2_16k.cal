# Calibration table as of 6/7/95.
# Calibration set for 400 kHz input frequency. 
# Linear calibration on decompressed output.
# Output in mV/m 1/2 Vpp.
# Since data collected requires only 12 bits, there will be little 
# discrepency in data between frequency domains, so BBF files are 
# identical for two given spheres. 
0			Time in seconds.
-1.269			Zerolevel (raw).
3.185			Gain (in exponent).
