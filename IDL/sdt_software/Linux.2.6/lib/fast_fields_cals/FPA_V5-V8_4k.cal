# Amplitude vs frequency is renormalized with amplitude array.
# Frequecies in amplitude array are in kHz!
# Cof_type 0 - polynomial fit up to 9th order (10 cofs).
# Cof_type 1 - High pass filters up to 10 1-pole filters.
# Cof_type 2 - Low pass filters up to 10 1-pole filters.
# Cof_type 3 - Simple RC-CC crossover. Give: crossover
#              frequency , capacitive coupled gain.
