:MainMenu
This is the Main Menu for the SDT, the SSL
DataAnalysis Tool.  It provides choices which
allow the user to create, manipulate, save and
recall Configurations of PlotWindows and the Plots
which they contain.

If a preexisting Configuration exists, the user
should call it up through the Configuration menu
series.  If not one should start from scratch by
selecting the "Blank" configuration from the 
Configuration menu series.  The user should then
add plots, arrange them in the desired order, etc.
using the PlotWindow Menus.  Then the user should
select a timespan using the TimeSpan Menu series.

These are a short list of Ingredients for Cooking
up a Configuration:
   add Blank Plot Window
   add Plot Panels
   select a TimeSpan
   adjust Parameters

:ConfigurationButton
This is the Configuration Button and is the 
starting point for the Configuration Menu Series.
This Button, when selected using the Right Mouse
Button provides a menu which will allow a user to
select, save, save as..., or delete Configurations.

select - choosing this with the Right Mouse button
	 gives the user the list of the pre-
	 existing Configurations.  By choosing one
	 of these, the program will recreate that
	 Configuration as it was saved.
save   - choosing this will save the current
	 arrangement of PlotWindows, Plots,
	 Timespans as the last Configuration
	 requested.  If no preexisting
	 Configuration was requested, the user
	 will be prompted for a name.
save as- choosing this will prompt the user for a
	 name under which to save this new
	 configuration.  the user should use a
	 name which does not contain a '/' or a
	 '-'.
delete - choosing this with the Right Mouse button
	 gives the user the list of the pre-
	 existing Configurations.  By choosing one
	 of these, the program will delete that
	 Configuration after verification from the
	 user.

:PlotWindowButton
This is the PlotWindow Button and is the way in
which the user can add or delete PlotWindows of
various types.  Selecting this Button with the
Left Mouse Button will add a Standard PlotWindow
to the screen.  Selecting this Button with the
Right Mouse Button provides the user with a menu
which will allow the addition of a RealTime or 
Standard PlotWindow or to delete a window.  If the
user selects "add standard", a Standard PlotWindow
will be added to the screen.  If the user selects
"add realtime", a RealTime PlotWindow will be
added to the screen.  If the user selects "remove"
with the Right Mouse Button a list of the existing
PlotWindows will be given.  If the user chooses
one, it will be deleted after verification from
the user.
#

########################50########################
:TimeSpanButton
This is the TimeSpan Button and is used to set the
timespan for plots which exist in the 
Configuration and plots which are added 
subsequently.

When selected with the Left Mouse Button is used
to set the TimeSpan for all of the existing plots
in the Configuration.  

When selected with the Right Mouse Button, it
provides a menu which will allow setting the
timespan for all the existing plots (same as the
Left Mouse Button case) or some of the plots.  The
user will follow through several menus and will be
prompted to select the plots he/she is concerned
with at the last.

The TimeSpan can be set either before or after
adding plot panels and setting the TimeSpan for a
plot which already has a TimeSpan associated with
it resets the TimeSpan for that plot to the new
one.
#

########################50########################
:ParameterButton
This is the Parameter Button and is used to reset
and use Parameters for existing plots with
TimeSpans and associated Parameters.

When selected and parameters exist for the
Configuration (for the Plot Quantities within the
Configuration) a window appears with those 
parameters and the values which were previously
assigned to them and to compute the current data.

If the user dismisses this window by pressing the
Left Mouse button on the pushpin in the upper-left
hand corner of the window, then nothing happens:
no parameters are reset, no recomputation of data.

If the user adjusts some parameters and selects 
the Compute button on this menu, then all of the
parameters are reset to the values set in the 
window and all of the quantities which could have
parameters are recomputed.
#

########################50########################
:PrintSetupButton
This is the Print SetUp Button and is used to set
defaults for hardcopy output.

When selected the user is presented with a window
which will allow the user to set the output device
destination, output type, paper size and 
orientation.

GENERAL TOPICS

Getting Started:
   - Bring up an empty Plot Window by pressing
     the Right Mouse button on the Configuration
     button on the main SDT menu.  Likewise
     choose Select then Blank from the ensuing
     menus.
   - Add plots by choosing "Add Plot", then the
     appropriate space craft from the action menu
     obtained by depressing the Right Mouse button
     within the Plot Window.
   - Select a TimeSpan by pressing the Right Mouse
     button on the Timespan button on the main SDT
     menu.  Select "All Plots" from the next menu.
     Continue filling in the selections until no
     more options are given.  At this point data
     should begin appearing after a short while.

Mouse Button use:
   The Right Mouse button can be used to get
   menus.  When depressed within the Plot Window
   the user will get menus used to manipulate
   plot/quantities ( add/delete plots, set limits,
   etc.).  If the user depresses the Right Mouse
   button within the plot border of a particular
   plot, the user will get a menu which actions
   pertain only to that particular plot or which
   are valid for only one plot at a time.  If the
   user depresses the Right Mouse button in the
   general space around the plot panel, the user
   will get a menu which has actions apply to all
   plots or to the window.  Additionally, when a
   vertical or horizontal caret is seen at the
   left of a button or menu item one can press the
   Right Mouse button to see a menu which lists
   additional selections.

   Generally, the best button to use is the Left
   Mouse Button.  It is the action button and when
   it is pressed completes the action you are
   selecting, such as selection buttons or menu
   items.  If one selects the Left Mouse button
   the default from that menu will be used!

   The Left and Middle Mouse buttons also can be
   used to set the zoom fiducial lines.  When the
   user presses either of these buttons within the
   plot window, a line will appear on the screen
   which indicates what the zoom area will be.

Known Bugs and Work Arounds:
   1) If the user exceeds the amount of RAM,
      the program will crash.
   2) Occasionally, the Science Modules will not
      get displayed.  type 'run' then 'run' again.

########################50########################
:QuitButton
This is the Quit Button and is used to exit the
program.

When selected with the Left Mouse Button, the
current Configuration is saved and the program is
exited.

When selected with the Right Mouse Button, the
user is given a menu to allow the user to save the
Configuration (same as Left Mouse Button case),
save the Configuration under a new name, or just
to discard the Configuration altogether.
#

########################50########################
:PlotWindowCanvas
This is the PlotWindow Canvas and is where all
plots are displayed.  In addition it is where the
user manipulates plots to better represent their
data.

When the user depresses the Right Mouse Button
inside this window, a menu appears which allows
manipulations which pertain to the entire 
PlotWindow.  This allows the user to add plots,
set the number of plots per page, print the 
PlotWindow, zoom all of the plots, set lines/
points for all plots, and so on.

When Plot Panels are displayed, the user can
depress the Right Mouse Button inside of the
individual Plot Panel to get a menu to allow the
user to manipulate just that one plot.  
Manipulations include setting limits, deleting the
plot, zooming, moving the plot within the
PlotWindow, showing extra information about that
plot, and so on.
