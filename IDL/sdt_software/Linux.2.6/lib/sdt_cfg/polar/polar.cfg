# This file contains startup configuration paramenters for the

# This controls what type of memory is used:
#   0 -> shared-memory
#   1 -> mapped-memory files.
# Most people will use shared-memory ("0")

MEMORY_TYPE:  0

#
# These entries control how playbacks (cpu1 bursts, cpu2 bursts, and
# sdt7 sweeps) are time-tagged.
#
#   0 -> realtime
#   1 -> Playback time
#
# All co-I's and anyone performing scientific data analysis should
# always use "realtime" - i.e. "0".   Only Berkeley, in certain
# diagnostic situations, would ever want to use playback time.

Sdt7TimingMode:        0
CPU1BurstTimingMode:   0
CPU2BurstTimingMode:   0

#
# This flag indicates whether or not you wish POLAR to rigorously
# check each file in a data directory to see if it is an EFI level
# level-zero file.  This is safer, but much slower when using the
# SDT file-select mechanism.  If the flag is OFF (the default in a
# release), then POLAR will only scan for EFI level-zero files with
# project-naming convention.  No GSE files or LZ files with non-standard
# names will be listed in this case.  CDrom scanning still works.
#
# If you wish to be able to look at POLAR GSE files or EFI LZ files with
# non-project names (e.g. near-realtime generated files), you should
# turn this flag ON, by uncommenting the "VerifyEfiLzFilesForType" line.
