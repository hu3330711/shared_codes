#
# File which configures the activities of "fast_cd_xfer", which
# downloads FAST CD data directories to a remote site, from the
# FAST data disks in Berkeley (perhaps on a daily basis as a
# cronjob).
#
# NOTE:  This file MUST reside in the HOME directory of the user
# who invokes it.  It is in the user's HOME directory that the
# "fast_cd_xfer" program looks for "fast_cd_xfer.cfg".
#
# It is also REQUIRED that the user have SSH appropriately configured
# so that he/she can ssh into "juneau" in the same manner as for the
# "datamgr", without requiring the password.
#
#
# Here is a description of the records contained by this file:
#
#
#   The following MUST be set in this file:
#
#   InputDirectory:        pathname
#      This record indicates which Berkeley disk directory will be
#      scanned for new data.
#      As of 2005/12/10, this directory was:
#           /disks/FAST_CD_27
#
#   OutputDirectory:       pathname
#      This record indicates which disk directory at "stelab"
#      will receive the FAST CD directories from Berkeley.
#      As of 2005/12/10, this directory was:
#           /fast/data5/cd27
#
#   MaxCDsPerExecution:    integer > 0
#      This value indicates the maximum number of FAST CD
#      directories which will be retrieved during the execution
#      of "fast_cd_xfer".   This limit exists in order to insure
#      that the program does not run for too much time each day,
#      or attempt to transfer more data than the network can
#      effectively handle.
#      As of 2005/12/10, this value was set to "5" CD directories.
#
#   MinimumDirectoryAge:   integer > 0
#      This value indicates how old a FAST CD directory must be
#      before it is downloaded.  By "age", we refer to the time
#      since the previous "write" to the directory.   It is assumed
#      that a CD directory must be at least two or three days old
#      to indicate that Berkeley will not be putting any more data
#      into it.  This should insure that "stelab" only downloads
#      the final, complete version of FAST CD directories.  Also
#      note that "fast_cd_xfer" attempts to always download the
#      "oldest" CD directories first.
#      As of 2005/12/10, this value was set to "10" days.
#
#
#   The following are optional:
#
#   SiteName:       name
#      This record indicates the name of the site that will be
#      output in messages, to the "fast_cd_xfer.msg" file.
#      Default:  stelab
#      
#   SshProg:       name
#      This record indicates the fullpathame of the "ssh" program
#      to be used to contact the Berkeley FAST data server.
#      Default:  /usr/local/bin/ssh
#
#   TarProg:       name
#      This record indicates the fullpathame of the "tar" program,
#      to be used locally, as part of the transfer process.
#      Default:  /usr/bin/tar
#
