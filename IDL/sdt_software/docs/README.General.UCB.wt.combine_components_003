   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module combines components of an input quantity
       using functions of 2 variables, and computes errors.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



        1) The input to be operated upon.


           This input has the data components to be combined, and their
           errors.





    3) There can be any number of output combinations of input
       components; the minimum is 1.





    4) The functions that can be used are contained in the
       general-purpose function Gen_F_2_Var_002.





    5) Each combination of 2 input components is used to create
       ultimately an output quantity.



       Different output quantities can use different function codes.





    6) An output data point is produced for each input data point;
       provided that all of the output quantities can be produced.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input data point.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0      =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1   =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                              dump frequency); i.e., every n-th point.

                    <= -1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-1)  (where -n is the
                              chosen dump frequency); i.e., the first n
                              points.



            2) Number of output data quantities.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            3) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the output data quantities.



                1) Input component index for input variable 1.


                   Int.



                2) Input component index for the error for input
                   variable 1.


                   Int.



                3) Input component index for input variable 2.


                   Int.



                4) Input component index for the error for input
                   variable 2.


                   Int.



                5) Code for the function of 2 variables.


                   Int.


                   Must be a valid function code for compute mode.



                6) Auxiliary int parameters for the function of 2
                   variables.


                   Int.


                   The exact number depends on the function code, and
                   can be zero.



                7) Auxiliary double parameters for the function of 2
                   variables.


                   Double.


                   The exact number depends on the function code, and
                   can be zero.





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



            1) The data input for the quantities to be combined.


               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.

                   Double.

                   Must be component 0.


                2) One or more additional components for quantities to
                   be combined.

                   Float.


                3) One or more additional components for the errors for
                   the quantities to be combined.

                   Float.


               The components for the quantities and the components for
               the errors can be in any order, and can be intermingled.





    6) The SDT output data quantity is a time series (Standard data
       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) One component for the 1st. output quantity.


               Float.



            3) One component for the error for the 1st. output quantity.


               Float.



            4) Additional pairs of components for the subsequent output
               quantities and their errors.


               Float.
