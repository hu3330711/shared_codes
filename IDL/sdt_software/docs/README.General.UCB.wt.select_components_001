   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module selects a number of data components from a
       single input.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) The input from which the components are to be selected.





    3) 1 or more input data components can be selected to be used.





    4) Each input data component that is selected must be used to
       generate at least 1 output data quantity.





    5) A selected input data component can be used multiple times.



       Since each input data component that is not selected is not used
       at all; and since each input data component that is selected can
       be used once, or more than once; the number of data quantities in
       the output can be less than, equal to, or greater than the number
       of data quantities in the input.





    6) For each selected input component, there is the option of
       specifying limits and ignoring data values beyond the limits.



       An input data point is considered only if all the selected data
       components have valid values.





    7) An output data point is produced for each input data point;
       provided that the selected components have valid values (if
       limits are specified).



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as the time
       tag of the corresponding input data point.



       The data quantity values for the output data point are the same
       as the quantity values of the selected components of the
       corresponding input data point.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Number of output data quantities.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            3) Number of input data quantities selected to be used.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            4) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the input data quantities selected.



                1) Flag for limits.


                   Int.


                   Must be one of the following:


                       WT_TRUE   =  Use limits for input values.

                       WT_FALSE  =  Do not use limits for input values.



                2) Lower limit.


                   Double.



                3) Upper limit.


                   Double.



               If the flag for limits is true, then
               the lower limit  must be  <=  the upper limit.



                4) Input component index.


                   Int.



            5) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the output data components.



                1) Input component index.


                   Int.





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



            1) The data input for the data components to be selected.


               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.

                   Double.

                   Must be component 0.


                2) One or more additional components, for the values of
                   the data quantities.

                   Float.





    6) The SDT output data quantity is a time series (Standard data
       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) One component for each output quantity.


               Float.





    7) The following output data files are written:



           None.
