Description of the "FastCount" Program:
--------------------------------------

In order to be able to view Fast data with SDT in Data Analysis Mode,
a "set" of Fast data must be "counted" by the program:

    $FASTBIN/FastCount

Note that there are two types of "sets" of Fast data:

    1.  Captured Fast Relay session files, hereby called
        "PDU files".

    2.  "Directory Sets" of LZP-generated post-pass data, hereby
	called  "PPS data".  These are NOT single files but
	directories, whose names are of the form:

            fast_lzp_GNDSTN_orbitnnnn_y

        where "GNDSTN", "nnnn", and "y" are as defined in the LZP
	documentation.  It is this data that will be stored in
	the official Fast data base.


Usage of the "FastCount" program is as follows:

    $FASTBIN/FastCount  DType  InDir=InputDir  File=FName  OutDir= OutDir

    Arguments:

	 DType:    Required:  Indicates which data set type to be
		   counted.  Must be one of:

		       PDU
		       DA

	 InputDir:  Optional:  The name of the directory in which
		    the data set(s) exist.  If not used, then the
		    current working directory is assumed to be
		    the location of the Fast data to be counted.

	 FName:     Optional:  If used, it is the name of the PDU file
		    or DA data set to be counted, within "InputDir".
		    If not used, then, if DType == PDU, all PDU files
		    in "InputDir" will be counted, or, if DType == DA,
		    all PPS data sets in "InputDir" will be counted.

	 OutputDir: Optional:  The name of the directory in which to
		    put the generated count files.  If not used, the
		    count files are put into the current working
		    directory.


The "FastCount" program produces a count file for each Fast data set
it scans.  In the case of a PDU file, the name of the file is:

      pdufilename.cnt

where "pdufilename" is the name of the PDU file.  In the PPS data case,
the name of the count file is of the form:

     fast_lzp_GNDSTN_orbitnnnn_y.cnt

where "GNDSTN", "nnnn", and "y" are as defined in the LZP documentation.

Note that the count file is ASCII and can be read into a "C" program by
use of the library:

     libfastcount.a

The program also produces, in the current working directory, a diagnostic
file:

    outfastcnt

and an error file:

    errfastcnt

If the count files were successfully generated, "errfastcnt" should be
of zero length.


Examples:

    1.  In order to "count" all of the PDU files in the directory:

	     /disks/juneau/disk2/gsedata

        and put the count files in that same directory, enter:

	     $FASTBIN/FastCount PDU InDir=/disks/juneau/disk2/gsedata \
	     OutDir=/disks/juneau/disk2/gsedata

    2.  In order to "count" the PDU file:

	     it_esa_burst

        inside directory:

	     /disks/juneau/disk2/gsedata/ITdata

        and put the count file into your current working directory, enter:

	   $FASTBIN/FastCount PDU InDir=/disks/juneau/disk2/gsedata/ITdata \
	   File=it_esa_burst

    3.  In order to "count" the PPS data set:

	     /diska/lzp/fast_lzp_DSS-16_orbit0027_r

        and put the count file into:
	
	   /diska/lzp/fast_lzp_DSS-16_orbit0027_r

	enter:

	   $FASTBIN/FastCount DA InDir=/diska/lzp \
	   File=fast_lzp_DSS-16_orbit0027_r \
	   OutDir=/diska/lzp/fast_lzp_DSS-16_orbit0027_r

        Note that:

	    fast_lzp_DSS-16_orbit0027_r

        is not a file, but a sub-directory of "/diska/lzp".
