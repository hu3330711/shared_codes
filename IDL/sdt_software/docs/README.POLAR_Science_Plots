    1. Introduction.





       This document describes plots of Science quantities that are
available for POLAR data.



       In order to display these plots, one can use the program "sdt".





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2. Types of plots.





       The program "sdt" can be used to create several types of plots.



       While this document is concerned with Science plots only, it is
helpful to have some understanding of all the plot types and how they
are related.



       The various types of plots are described in the sections that
follow.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2.1 Raw quantities.





       Generally speaking, POLAR raw quantities are created by a program
(part of "sdt") called the POLAR Decommutator, using as input mainly the
following:

           Level zero electric field data.

           Level zero magnetic field data.

           Orbit data.

           Attitude data.

           Spin phase key parameter data.



       When a plot of a raw quantity is produced, in general the user
has no control on how the quantity is determined; i.e., there are no
parameters to be used in the calculation, that the user could adjust.

       There are exceptions to this, however; in other words, there can
be raw quantities, produced by the POLAR Decommutator, for which there
may be parameters that the user can adjust.



       It should be noted that the name "Raw" is used here only to
indicate that the quantity is produced by the POLAR Decommutator.  In
fact, Raw quantities may have undergone a significant degree of
processing (calibrations, etc.).





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2.2 Science quantities.





       POLAR Science quantities are produced by a set of programs (also
part of "sdt") known collectively as Science Modules, using as input:

           Raw quantities.

           Other Science quantities.



       The creation of a Science quantity will always require running
the POLAR Decommutator; but because Science Modules can use Science
quantities as inputs to create other Science quantities, the creation of
a Science quantity may involve a number of Science Modules running to
produce intermediate Science quantities.



       When a plot of a Science quantity is produced, there may be user
parameters to be used in the calculation, that the user could adjust.
       When this is the case, the user is prompted for the values of the
parameters.
       Furthermore, after the plot is completed, the user can change
parameter values and have "sdt" recompute the Science quantity and
display a new plot.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2.3 Special SSL Science quantities.





       POLAR Special SSL Science quantities are Science quantities, just
like the ones described before.



       However, these quantities are kept in a separate plot menu,
because they are intended for special use at SSL: for diagnostics,
special projects, etc.  SSL stands for the University of California,
Berkeley, Space Sciences Laboratory.



       Users interested in of any of these plots can get more
information from SSL.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3. General information on Science quantity plots.





       The information in this section is helpful to a better
understanding of all the Science plots.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.1 Time resolution.





       For magnetic field data, there are 2 time resolutions:



           1) Instantaneous.

              This is usually about 8 data points per second.



           2) Spin period.

              This results from a least-squares spin fit of the
              instantaneous data; there is about 1 data point per 6
              seconds.




       For electric field data, there are 3 time resolutions:



           1) Instantaneous.

              This is usually about 40 data points per second for V12L,
              V34L, and V56L; and about 1 data point per 0.4 seconds for
              V1L, V2L, V3L, V4L, V5L, V6L.



           2) Burst.

              This is either 1600 data points per second, or 8000 data
              points per second.



           3) Spin period.

              This results from a least-squares spin fit of the
              instantaneous data; there is about 1 data point per 6
              seconds.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.2 Names of burst plots.





       The name of each burst plot contains a 3-letter portion that is
       one of the following:


           BBL

           MBL

           BBU

           MBU



       The first letter indicates the CPU associated with the burst:

           B = Burst CPU (CPU 2).

           M = Main CPU (CPU 1).



       The third letter indicates the type of electric field instrument
       output, depending on the applicable band-pass filter:

           L = Low.

           U = Unfiltered.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.3 Names of spin period plots.





       The name of each spin period plot generally contains the letter
       A, to indicate that it is an average.



       The name also contains one of the following:


           12

           34



       The spin fit of V12L and the spin fit of V34L are performed
       starting at different phase angles within the spin period.

       Therefore, the two spin fits have different time tags.



       For spin period electric field data that could come from either
       the instantaneous V12L or the instantaneous V34L; "12" or "34"
       indicates which of the two sets of instantaneous data was used to
       generate the spin period data.



       For other spin period electric field data, and for spin period
       magnetic field data; "12" or "34" indicates which of the two sets
       of time tags applies.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.4 Coordinate systems.





       The coordinate systems used for POLAR are documented elsewhere.




       The main coordinate systems for Science plots are:


           GSE = Geocentric Solar Ecliptic.


           GSM = Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric.


           FAC = Field-Aligned Coordinates.




       For FAC, there are really 3 different coordinate systems,
       depending on the magnetic field used to define them:


           FAC_I, defined by the instantaneous magnetic field.


           FAC_S, defined by the spin period magnetic field.


           FAC_M, defined by the model magnetic field.




       While in principle any FAC coordinate system can be used for any
       data, in practice these coordinate systems are used as follows:


           FAC_I  is used for instantaneous and for burst data.


           FAC_S  is used for spin period data.


           FAC_M  is used for all data (instantaneous, burst, spin
                  period).




       Other coordinate systems for Science plots are:


           SPC = Spin Plane Coordinates.

                 The SPC coordinate axes are called X-Y, Z, 56.


           GEI = Geocentric Equatorial Inertial.

                 Also designated ECI, or GCI.




       All the coordinate systems above are non-rotating; i.e., they do
       not participate in the rotation of the spacecraft.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.5 Minimum time span for plots.





       In general, Science plots require the use of auxiliary quantities
       (attitude, spin pulse, etc.); these quantities are fetched
       automatically by "sdt" when needed.



       For a point to be plotted, it must be in the time interval
       defined by 2 data points for the attitude, if the attitude is
       needed; and it must be in the time interval defined by 2 data
       points for the spin pulse, if the spin pulse is needed; etc.



       Of these auxiliary quantities, the one with the most coarse time
       resolution within "sdt" is the attitude.  In "sdt", the attitude
       has one data point every 600 seconds; they occur exactly on the
       hour, on the hour + 10 minutes, etc.



       Therefore, it is best to request a time interval that begins a
       little before the last multiple of 10 minutes preceding the data
       to be plotted; and that ends a little after the first multiple of
       10 minutes following the data to be plotted.



       For example, if the data to be plotted is for the time interval

           04:27:30 - 04:32:10

       then it would be advisable to request an interval such as

           04:19:00 - 04:41:00

       (or simply  04:19 - 04:41 , as "sdt" assumes the seconds to be
       zero if omitted).



       Another example: if the data to be plotted is for the time
       interval

           04:20:00 - 04:40:00

       then it would be advisable to request the same interval as in
       the previous example, i.e.,

           04:19 - 04:41




       Note that, once a plot has been produced, one can always use the
       Zoom function of "sdt" to look at a smaller time interval.




       Another reason to extend the time interval is that the
       processing of important quantities (such as the magnetic field
       and the electric field) can include the computation of averages
       over a number of spin periods; these computations cannot be
       performed near the beginning and the end of the time interval.

       An extra "padding" of 10 to 30 minutes at each end should be
       amply sufficient in most cases.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.6 Electric field quantities and magnetic field.





       We can think of the process of creating a plot of a vector
       quantity related to the electric field, as consisting of 2 parts:



           1) Determination of the vector quantity itself.



           2) Rotation of the vector quantity into the desired
              coordinate system.




       Examples of such vector quantities include: the various versions
       of E itself; the "transformed" E, or E_T; and the ExB plasma
       velocity v.




       The determination of the vector quantity may involve the use of
       the magnetic field:



           1) The angles between the electric field instrument booms and
              B, and the latitude of B with respect to the spin plane;
              can be used to select data points for the instantaneous
              and the burst spin plane components of E.



           2) B may appear in the calculation of the vector quantity (e.
              g., to determine the spin axis component of E_Dot0; to
              determine the VxB correction for E_T; or to calculate v).



       The magnetic field used to determine these vector quantities is
       always the measured magnetic field; this document specifies in
       each case whether the B used is the instantaneous B or the spin
       period B.




       Once the vector quantity has been obtained, it can be plotted in
       any one of a number of coordinate systems, such as GSE or GSM.



       If the choice is made to plot the vector quantity in a coordinate
       system such as FAC, then the magnetic field is involved once
       again, in the definition of the coordinate system.



       However, depending on the FAC system chosen, the magnetic field
       used to define the coordinate system may be the same that was
       used when obtaining the vector quantity, or may be different.



       For example, the magnetic field involved in obtaining the
       instantaneous E_Dot0 is the instantaneous B.

       If the instantaneous E_Dot0 is plotted in FAC_I, then the
       instantaneous B is used again, to define the coordinate system.

       If, on the other hand, the instantaneous E_Dot0 is plotted in
       FAC_M, then the model B is used to define the coordinate system.
       So, in this case we use first the instantaneous B to calculate
       E_Dot0, and then we use the model B to define the coordinate
       system into which to rotate that previously calculated E_Dot0.




       The situation can be more complicated in the case of spin period
       time resolution.

       As an extreme example, if we want to plot the spin period E_Dot0
       in FAC_M, then we use the following versions of B:

           1) Instantaneous B, to select data points for the
              instantaneous spin plane components of E.

           2) Spin period B, to calculate the spin axis component of
              E_Dot0.

           3) Model B, to define the coordinate system for the plot.




       The plasma potential is a scalar quantity, so the issue of which
       coordinate system to plot it in does not arise.

       However, the plasma potential is defined by E and ds (the
       element of distance traveled by the spacecraft), both of which
       are vectors, and both of which are required by the definition to
       be in a particular FAC coordinate system.

       Therefore, after E has been obtained, which requires B; B will be
       involved again, in the definition of that FAC coordinate system.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.7 Input quantities and plot operations.





       Usually, plot quantities are chosen from plot menus.  The input
       quantities for these plots are generally fixed, the user cannot
       specify which input quantities to use.




       However, some plots can be created "on the fly" by means of "plot
       operations".

       Here, the user chooses a plot, and chooses an operation to apply
       to that plot.

       The result is one or more new plots, for which the user has
       chosen the input quantities.




       Within this document, Science plots that can be created by means
       of plot operations will be described as appropriate.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.8 Convolution.





       Convolution is available as a "plot operation".




       Users interested in this subject can get more information from
       SSL.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.9 Vector orientation.





       Some plots provide the orientation of some vectors with respect
       to some particular coordinate system.




       What is provided is the following:



           1) Direction cosines.

              These are the cosines of the angles between the vector and
              the positive X, Y, and Z coordinate axes.

              The direction cosines are the same as the components of
              the normalized vector.



           2) Direction angles.

              These are the angles between the vector and the positive
              X, Y, and Z coordinate axes.



           3) Latitude and longitude.

              These are the latitude and longitude that correspond to
              the direction of the vector; with respect to the
              coordinate system.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4. Details on the computation of Science quantities.





       This section has information on how the main Science quantities
are calculated.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.1 Magnetic field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.1.1 Instantaneous magnetic field.





       The instantaneous magnetic field comes from the measured values
       of the magnetic field.




       The instantaneous magnetic field is obtained as follows:




           1) Determination of spin period average offsets.



              There are 2 offsets: one for MFE_X, one for MFE_Y.


              Each offset is a spin period running average; the number
              of spin periods used for the running average can be
              specified by the user.


              The running average is obtained by taking all the data
              points within the specified number of spin periods, and
              averaging their values to obtain one output data point;
              then, the points in the first spin period are discarded,
              a new spin period is added at the end, and a new average
              is computed for the next output data point; etc.


              It is clear that the running average has one data point
              for each spin period.


              The user can specify also the minimum number of input data
              points required per spin period, in order to determine an
              offset.



              The inputs used to obtain the offsets are the
              instantaneous "corrected MFE_X 2", or the instantaneous
              "corrected MFE_Y 2".




              The "corrected MFE_X 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected MFE_X" described below; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.


              This is analogous for MFE_Y.




           2) Applying correction terms.



              Each spin plane component of the magnetic field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Constant offset.




           3) Applying correction terms.



              Each spin plane component of the magnetic field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Spin period average offset.




          This produces a "corrected MFE_X" and a "corrected MFE_Y".




           4) Despinning of spin plane components.



              This removes the effect of having the spin plane
              components of B measured by an instrument that rotates
              with the spacecraft.




       Most important user parameters:

           Constant offset for each of MFE_X, MFE_Y.

           Choice of subtracting spin period average offsets from the
           spin plane components.

           Minimum number of points per spin period.

           Number of spin periods for spin period average offsets.

    4.1.2 Spin period magnetic field.





       The spin period magnetic field comes from the measured values of
       the magnetic field.




       The spin period magnetic field is obtained as follows:




           1) The spin plane components come from a least-squares spin
              fit of the "corrected MFE_X 2".




              The "corrected MFE_X 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected MFE_X" described above; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.




           2) The spin axis component comes from a least-squares spin
              fit of the Z component of the instantaneous magnetic
              field.




       The minimum number of data points per spin period, specified by
       the user and used to obtain the spin period average offsets for
       the spin plane components; is also used as a minimum number of
       data points required for the spin fits.




       Most important user parameters:

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous magnetic field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2 Electric field.





       In what follows, reference is made to the components of the
       electric field that can be measured: V12, V34, and V56.



       However, sphere 5 of the electric field instrument failed on
       2006/03/02.

       Following the failure of sphere 5, no measurement of V56 is
       possible.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.1 Instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.1.1 Instantaneous electric field, spin plane components.





       The spin plane components of the instantaneous electric field are
       obtained as follows:




           1) Selection by avoidance of B.



              Input data points for V12L are selected only if:

               1) The angle between the 12 boom and the B vector is
                  greater than or equal to a chosen minimum value; and

               2) The angle between the 12 boom and the -B vector is
                  greater than or equal to the minimum value.



              The user can specify the minimum value (minimum angle)
              used in this selection.



              The user can specify also a threshold value for the
              magnitude of the B vector, |B|.

              If |B| is less than the threshold, this selection step is
              not performed, and no data points are discarded on account
              of it.

              This is because if |B| is very small, the direction of the
              B vector may be considered to be poorly defined; and also
              because a very weak B will not affect the electric field
              measurements as much.



              An analogous selection is done for V34L, based on the
              angle between the 34 boom and B (and the angle between the
              34 boom and -B).



              It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on
              the spin plane; but B and -B are full, 3-dimensional
              vectors, and their spin plane and their spin axis
              components are used in these calculations.




           2) Selection by latitude of B.



              Input data points for V12L are selected only if the
              absolute value of the latitude of the B vector with
              respect to the spin plane is greater than or equal to a
              chosen minimum value.



              The user can specify the minimum value (minimum latitude)
              used in this selection.



              The threshold value for |B|, used in the previous step, is
              used here as well.

              If |B| is less than the threshold, this selection step is
              not performed, and no data points are discarded on account
              of it.

              This is because if |B| is very small, the direction of the
              B vector may be considered to be poorly defined; and also
              because a very weak B will not affect the electric field
              measurements as much.



              An analogous selection is done for V34L.




          The magnetic field used to select the data points is the
          instantaneous B.




           3) Selection by avoidance of the Sun vector.



              Input data points for V12L are selected only if:

               1) The angle between the 12 boom and the Sun vector S is
                  greater than or equal to a chosen minimum value; and

               2) The angle between the 12 boom and the -S vector is
                  greater than or equal to the minimum value.



              The user can specify the minimum value (minimum angle)
              used in this selection.



              An analogous selection is done for V34L, based on the
              angle between the 34 boom and S (and the angle between the
              34 boom and -S).



              It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on
              the spin plane; but S and -S are full, 3-dimensional
              vectors, and their spin plane and their spin axis
              components are used in these calculations.




           4) The result of the selection steps above is a "selected
              V12L" and a "selected V34L".


              These are the data points that satisfy all the selection
              criteria.



              From now on, only the selected data points are used.




           5) Determination of spin period average offsets.



              There are 2 offsets: one for V12L, one for V34L.


              Each offset is a spin period running average; the number
              of spin periods used for the running average can be
              specified by the user.


              The running average is obtained by taking all the data
              points within the specified number of spin periods, and
              averaging their values to obtain one output data point;
              then, the points in the first spin period are discarded,
              a new spin period is added at the end, and a new average
              is computed for the next output data point; etc.


              It is clear that the running average has one data point
              for each spin period.


              The user can specify also the minimum number of input data
              points required per spin period, in order to determine an
              offset.



              The inputs used to obtain the offsets are the
              instantaneous "corrected V12L 2", or the instantaneous
              "corrected V34L 2".




              The "corrected V12L 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected V12L" described below; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.


              This is analogous for V34L.




           6) Applying correction terms.



              All of these corrections are applied at this point; some
              of them may be described more completely further below.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Constant offset.


               2) Sun angle correction.



              In addition, V12L can have the following offset
              subtracted:


               1) Offset that is a function of the spacecraft potential
                  S_C_Pot12.

                  The spacecraft potential used to determine this offset
                  is at instantaneous time resolution.




           7) Sun angle correction.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field has a
              correction subtracted, that is a multiple of the cosine of
              the azimuth angle of the boom on the spin plane; and a
              correction subtracted, that is a multiple of the sine of
              the azimuth angle of the boom on the spin plane.



              The coefficients for these correction terms can be
              specified by the user.



              The coefficients specified by the user are multiplied
              by an additional factor, which is the cosine of the
              latitude of the Sun vector (the vector from the Earth to
              the Sun) with respect to the spin plane.




           8) Scale.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field has its
              value multiplied by a constant scale factor.



              One reason to apply a scale factor is that the wires in
              the electric field instrument are at the spacecraft's
              potential; this has the effect of partially diminishing
              the potential difference between the spheres.

              The proper scale factor to correct for this effect varies
              somewhat; an average correction is a scale factor of 1.2.




           9) Applying correction terms.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Spin period average offset.




          This produces a "corrected V12L" and a "corrected V34L".




          10) Despinning of spin plane components.



              This removes the effect of having the spin plane
              components of E measured by an instrument that rotates
              with the spacecraft.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.1.2 Instantaneous electric field, spin axis component.





       The spin axis component of the instantaneous electric field is
       obtained as follows:




           1) Determination of the coefficients for the spin fit
              correction.



              A least-squares spin fit of V56L is performed.


              The coefficients obtained for the spin fit are averaged
              over a chosen time interval; each coefficient is weighted
              by the final number of points in the fit for the spin
              period.




           2) Applying correction terms.



              The spin axis component of the electric field can have the
              following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Constant offset.


               2) Spin fit correction, determined by the B and C
                  averaged spin fit coefficients (cosine and sine
                  terms).




           3) Scale.



              The spin axis component of the electric field has its
              value multiplied by a constant scale factor.



              One reason to apply a scale factor is that the wires in
              the electric field instrument are at the spacecraft's
              potential; this has the effect of partially diminishing
              the potential difference between the spheres.

              The proper scale factor to correct for this effect varies
              somewhat; an average correction is a scale factor of 1.2.




          This produces a "corrected V56L".




           4) 3 versions of the electric field.



              Because the measurement of the spin axis component of the
              electric field is not as accurate as the measurement of
              the spin plane components, 3 versions of the electric
              field are defined, depending on what is used for the value
              of the spin axis component.



              The spin plane components for all 3 versions of the
              electric field are the same.



               1) E.


                  For E ("plain E"), the spin axis component of the
                  electric field comes from the "corrected V56L", i.e.,
                  ultimately, from the measured spin axis values.



               2) E_0.


                  For E_0, the spin axis component of the electric field
                  is assumed to be zero.



               3) E_Dot0.


                  For E_Dot0, the spin axis component of the electric
                  field is assumed to have a value such, that the dot
                  product of E_Dot0 and B is zero.


                  If the spin plane axes are X and Y, then the spin axis
                  component for E_Dot0 will be determined by:

                      EZ = - (EX * BX + EY * BY) / BZ


                  This expression will not be well defined if |BZ| is
                  too small; or if either |BX/BZ| or |BY/BZ| is too
                  large.

                  The user can specify a lower limit for |BZ|, and an
                  upper limit for |BX/BZ| and |BY/BZ|; if either of
                  these limits is exceeded, E_Dot0 is undefined.




       The magnetic field used to determine E_Dot0 is the instantaneous
       B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Threshold for |B|.

           Minimum angle E spin plane boom and B vector.

           Minimum |latitude B|.

           Minimum angle E spin plane boom and Sun vector.

           Constant offset for each of V12, V34.

           Choice of subtracting spin period average offsets from each
           of V12, V34.

           Minimum number of points per spin period.

           Number of spin periods for spin period average offsets.

           Choice of subtracting from V12 an offset determined by
           S_C_Pot12.

           Cosine and sine coefficients for Sun angle correction for
           each of V12, V34.

           Constant scale factor for each of V12, V34.

           Constant offset for V56.

           Choice of subtracting from V56 a spin fit correction.

           Time interval to average the coefficients for the spin fit
           correction to V56.

           Constant scale factor for V56.

           Minimum |BZ| for E_Dot0.

           Maximum |BX/BZ|, |BY/BZ| for E_Dot0.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.2 Burst electric field.





       The burst electric field is obtained in the same manner as the
       instantaneous electric field; with the obvious difference that
       burst data is used instead of instantaneous data.




       There are, then, 3 versions of the burst electric field as well:
       E, E_0, and E_Dot0.



       The spin plane components for all 3 versions of the electric
       field are the same.




       The magnetic field used to select the data points, and to
       determine E_Dot0, is the instantaneous B.




       It must be noted that the instantaneous data values of V12L and
       V34L are still used for the burst electric field, in the
       determination of the spin average offsets for the spin plane
       component.


       For the offset for V12L that is a function of the spacecraft
       potential S_C_Pot12; the spacecraft potential that is used is the
       one at burst time resolution.


       In order to determine the spin fit correction for V56L, the
       instantaneous data values of V56L are used.




       Most important user parameters:

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.3 Spin period electric field.





       The spin period electric field is obtained as follows:




           1) The spin plane components come from a least-squares spin
              fit of: either the instantaneous "corrected V12L 2", or
              the instantaneous "corrected V34L 2".




              The "corrected V12L 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected V12L" described above; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.


              This is analogous for V34L.




           2) 3 versions of the electric field.



              For the spin period electric field we have also 3
              versions, depending on what is used for the value of the
              spin axis component.



              The spin plane components for all 3 versions of the
              electric field are the same.



               1) E.


                  For E ("plain E"), the spin axis component of the
                  electric field comes from a least-squares spin fit of
                  the instantaneous "corrected V56L 2", i.e.,
                  ultimately, from the measured spin axis values.


                  The "corrected V56L 2" is the same as the
                  instantaneous "corrected V56L" described above; except
                  that it does not have a spin fit correction
                  subtracted.



               2) E_0.


                  For E_0, the spin axis component of the electric field
                  is assumed to be zero.



               3) E_Dot0.


                  For E_Dot0, the spin axis component of the electric
                  field is assumed to have a value such, that the dot
                  product of E_Dot0 and B is zero.


                  The same limits specified by the user are applied, as
                  for the instantaneous and burst cases.




       The minimum number of data points per spin period, specified by
       the user and used to obtain the spin period average offsets for
       the spin plane components; is also used as a minimum number of
       data points required for the spin fits.




       The magnetic field used to determine E_Dot0 is the spin period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.3 Transformed electric field.





       The electric field obtained so far is in the frame of reference
       of the spacecraft.



       We can obtain the electric field in the frame of reference of the
       center of the Earth: E_T, E_0_T, E_Dot0_T.



       Each of these versions of the transformed E is obtained by adding
       to the corresponding E, E_0, or E_Dot0 the appropriate correction
       determined by

           V x B

       where V is the velocity of the spacecraft.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       and spin period transformed electric field; are the
       instantaneous, burst, and spin period data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used for the correction, for instantaneous and
       for burst data, is the instantaneous B; for spin period data, it
       is the spin period B.




       It should be noted that, although the spin axis component of E_0
       is zero (by definition); the spin axis component of E_0_T in
       general will not be zero.



       On the other hand, since E_Dot0 is perpendicular to B (by
       definition), and (V x B) is also perpendicular to B; E_Dot0_T
       will also be perpendicular to B.




       There are plot menus containing plots of the transformed electric
       field.

       In addition, it is possible to create "on the fly" plots of an E
       that is transformed by a constant velocity; the value of the
       constant velocity is specified by the user.

       The resulting quantity is calculated as: E + V x B.


       The procedure for creating an "on the fly" plot is as follows:

        1) At least 1 component of the E to be used must be plotted.
           At least 1 component of the B to be used must be plotted.

        2) Click the right mouse button on the plot of a component of E.
           In the menu that appears, select "Operations".
           In the menu that appears, select "E + Vconst x B".

        3) If the plot chosen has more than 1 line plot ("trace") in it,
           a box appears where 1 trace is to be chosen (click left mouse
           button), for a component of E.

        4) A box appears where:
            1) The values of the components of the velocity are to be
               entered.
            2) 1 quantity is to be chosen (click left mouse button), for
               B.

        5) Click the left mouse button on the "Compute" button.

        6) After the plots are created, the values entered for the
           components of the velocity can be changed via the
           "Parameter" button.


       It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that:

        1) The plot or trace selected for a component of E does, indeed,
           correspond to a component of an electric field.  E must be in
           units of mV/m.

        2) The quantity selected for B does, indeed, correspond to a
           magnetic field.  B must be in units of nT.

        3) The values entered for the components of the velocity V must
           be in units of km/sec.

        4) The components of E, B, and V all refer to the same
           orientation of coordinate system axes.

    4.4 Spacecraft potential.





       The spacecraft potential S_C_Pot12 is defined as follows:


           S_C_Pot12 = (V1 + V2) / 2



       The spacecraft potentials S_C_Pot34 and S_C_Pot56 are defined
       analogously.




       For instantaneous and for spin period time resolutions, V1, V2,
       etc. stand for V1L, V2L, etc., respectively.


       For burst time resolution, different spacecraft potentials can be
       obtained depending on whether the voltages that are used are all
       "L" or all "U".




       For instantaneous and for burst time resolutions, the spacecraft
       potentials come from individual data points for the voltages V1,
       V2, etc.; at instantaneous or burst time resolution,
       respectively.


       For spin period time resolution, the spacecraft potentials come
       from spin period averages of the instantaneous voltages V1, V2,
       etc.




       For all time resolutions, one additional spacecraft potential,
       S_C_Pot1234, is defined as follows:


           S_C_Pot1234 = (S_C_Pot12 + S_C_Pot34) / 2




       For burst time resolution, one additional quantity,
       S_C_Pot_Delta, is defined as follows:


           S_C_Pot_Delta = 2 * (S_C_Pot12 - S_C_Pot34)




       It should be noted that the voltages V1, V2, etc., at
       instantaneous or burst time resolution; or the spin period
       averages of the instantaneous voltages V1, V2,, etc.; are
       spacecraft potential values themselves.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.5 ExB plasma velocity.





       The ExB plasma velocity is determined as follows:


           v = (E x B) / (|B|^2)


       where ^ indicates exponentiation.




       The same threshold value for |B| that is used in the selection of
       data points for the instantaneous and burst electric fields, is
       used also in the computation of the ExB plasma velocity: the
       value of v is considered to be undefined if |B| is less than the
       threshold.




       Since there are 3 versions of the electric field, namely, E, E_0,
       and E_Dot0; therefore, 3 corresponding versions of the ExB plasma
       velocity are defined as well, depending on the version of the
       electric field that is used in the calculation.

       The 3 versions of the ExB plasma velocity are designated v, v_0,
       and v_Dot0.



       Furthermore, there are 3 versions of the transformed electric
       field, namely, E_T, E_0_T, and E_Dot0_T; and from these we can
       obtain 3 other versions of the ExB plasma velocity, designated as
       v_T, v_0_T, and v_Dot0_T.



       In summary, all 6 versions of the ExB plasma velocity are
       obtained using the same expression above, that involves E and B;
       the difference among them being which version of the electric
       field is used for E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       and spin period ExB plasma velocity; are the instantaneous,
       burst, and spin period data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used to obtain the ExB plasma velocity is the
       instantaneous B, for instantaneous and for burst data; for spin
       period data, it is the spin period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Threshold for |B|.




       There are plot menus containing plots of the ExB plasma velocity.

       In addition, it is possible to create "on the fly" plots of this
       quantity.


       The procedure for creating an "on the fly" plot is as follows:

        1) At least 1 component of the E to be used must be plotted.
           At least 1 component of the B to be used must be plotted.

        2) Click the right mouse button on the plot of a component of E.
           In the menu that appears, select "Operations".
           In the menu that appears, select "ExB Vel".

        3) If the plot chosen has more than 1 line plot ("trace") in it,
           a box appears where 1 trace is to be chosen (click left mouse
           button), for a component of E.

        4) A box appears where 1 quantity is to be chosen (click left
           mouse button), for B.

        5) Click the left mouse button on the "Compute" button.


       It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that:

        1) The plot or trace selected for a component of E does, indeed,
           correspond to a component of an electric field.  E must be in
           units of mV/m.

        2) The quantity selected for B does, indeed, correspond to a
           magnetic field.  B must be in units of nT.

        3) The components of E and B both refer to the same orientation
           of coordinate system axes.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.6 Plasma potential.





       The plasma potential is defined as follows:


           Plasma_Pot = - Integral of (E dot ds)


       where ds is the element of distance along the path of the
       spacecraft.




       In practice, instead of using ds in the computation, what is used
       is

           ds = V * dt

       where V is the spacecraft velocity, and dt is the element of
       time.




       E and ds are expressed in Field-Aligned Coordinates (FAC); and
       only the contributions to the dot product from the X and the Y
       components are used.  The contribution from the Z component (the
       component of E parallel to B) is excluded from the result.


       For instantaneous and for burst time resolution, the FAC
       coordinate system that is used to obtain the plasma potential is
       FAC_I.


       For spin period time resolution, the FAC coordinate system that
       is used to obtain the plasma potential is FAC_S.




       At the beginning of the time interval to be plotted, the value of
       the plasma potential is set to zero.


       Whenever there is a data dropout in E, the value of the integral
       remains "frozen" until more data points are available.


       In fact, data gaps in E can occur commonly, as data points are
       selected so as to exclude data when an electric field instrument
       boom is near the vector B (or -B).




       Since there are 3 versions of the electric field, namely, E, E_0,
       and E_Dot0; therefore, 3 corresponding versions of the plasma
       potential are defined as well, depending on the version of the
       electric field that is used in the calculation.

       The 3 versions of the plasma potential are designated Plasma_Pot,
       Plasma_Pot_0, and Plasma_Pot_Dot0.



       All 3 versions of the plasma potential are obtained using the
       same expression above, that involves E and ds; the difference
       among them being which version of the electric field is used for
       E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       and spin period plasma potential; are the instantaneous, burst,
       and spin period data, respectively.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.7 Plasma density.





       The plasma density n is obtained as a function of the spacecraft
       potential.




       The function is a power function, provided by Dr. Jack Scudder
       (University of Iowa).

       It comes from a fit to the POLAR Hydra particle data.

       The function was determined using data for 2001/04/01.

       The validity of the function for dates far from the date above
       has not been checked.




       n will be in units of cm^(-3), i.e., number of charges per cubic
       centimeter.




       By using the spacecraft potentials V1, V2, V3, V4, 12, 34, 1234;
       we obtain the plasma density n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_12, n_34,
       n_1234, respectively.



       The spacecraft potentials from spin axis measurements cannot be
       used to generate plasma density, because the function provided is
       valid only for the spin plane boom length.




       The spacecraft potential data used to obtain the instantaneous,
       burst, and spin period plasma density; are the instantaneous,
       burst, and spin period data, respectively.




       The user can specify an offset to be subtracted from the
       spacecraft potential; the result is used as the argument to the
       function to produce the plasma density.




       If the value of the argument to the function is too large, then
       the plasma density is set to a "missing value" of 1.0e+20.

       Also, if the value of the function is too large, then the result
       is not reliable, and therefore the plasma density is set to a
       "missing value" of 1.0e+20.

       If the value of the argument to the function is too small, then
       the plasma density is set to a "missing value" of 1.0e-20.





       Most important user parameters:

           Offset for the spacecraft potential.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.8 Poynting flux.





       The Poynting flux is determined as follows:


           Poyn_Flux = (Det E) x (Det B)


       where "Det" designates "detrended".




       The detrended vector E is the vector E minus a running average of
       the vector E; the detrended vector B is defined analogously.


       The running average is obtained by taking a time interval
       centered on each original data point, with a total duration equal
       to some number of spin periods; the original values for all the
       data points in the interval are averaged, and this becomes the
       new value for the data point.


       It is clear that the running average has one data point for each
       original data point.


       A running average can be obtained for instantaneous or spin
       period electric field data.

       A running average can be obtained for instantaneous or spin
       period magnetic field data.

       For instantaneous data, we average the instantaneous data point
       values; for spin period data, we average the spin period data
       point values.


       Note that when averaging spin period data, it is better to choose
       an odd number of spin periods; as this will assure that the
       exact number of data points (except for data gaps) is included in
       each average.  With an even number of spin periods, there will be
       uncertainty concerning the end points.


       For instantaneous or spin period data, the detrended vector is
       the original vector minus the corresponding running average.


       For burst data, the detrended E is the original E, minus the
       running average determined by the instantaneous E.




       Since there are 3 versions of the electric field, namely, E, E_0,
       and E_Dot0; therefore, 3 corresponding versions of the Poynting
       flux are defined as well, depending on the version of the
       electric field that is used in the calculation.

       The 3 versions of the Poynting flux are designated Poyn_Flux,
       Poyn_Flux_0, and Poyn_Flux_Dot0.



       Furthermore, there are 3 versions of the transformed electric
       field, namely, E_T, E_0_T, and E_Dot0_T; and from these we can
       obtain 3 other versions of the Poynting flux, designated as
       Poyn_Flux_T, Poyn_Flux_0_T, and Poyn_Flux_Dot0_T.



       In summary, all 6 versions of the Poynting flux are obtained
       using the same expression above, that involves E and B; the
       difference among them being which version of the electric field
       is used for E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       and spin period Poynting flux; are the instantaneous, burst, and
       spin period data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used to obtain the Poynting flux is the
       instantaneous B, for instantaneous and for burst data; for spin
       period data, it is the spin period B.




       It should be noted that, since the spin axis component of E_0 is
       zero (by definition); the spin axis component of the running
       average of E_0, and of the detrended E_0; will also be zero.



       On the other hand, even though E_Dot0 is perpendicular to B (by
       definition), and E_Dot0_T also is perpendicular to B; in general,
       the running average and the detrended E_Dot0 and E_Dot0_T, will
       not be perpendicular to B, or to the running average of B, or to
       the detrended B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Number of spin periods for the running averages.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.9 B flux.





       The B flux is defined as follows:


           B_flux = (E x B) / |B|




       The same threshold value for |B| that is used in the selection of
       data points for the instantaneous and burst electric fields, is
       used also in the computation of the B flux: the value of B_flux
       is considered to be undefined if |B| is less than the threshold.




       Since there are 3 versions of the electric field, namely, E, E_0,
       and E_Dot0; therefore, 3 corresponding versions of the B flux are
       defined as well, depending on the version of the electric field
       that is used in the calculation.

       The 3 versions of the B flux are designated B_Flux, B_Flux_0,
       and B_Flux_Dot0.



       In summary, all 3 versions of the B flux are obtained using the
       same expression above, that involves E and B; the difference
       among them being which version of the electric field is used for
       E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous and spin
       period B flux; are the instantaneous and spin period data,
       respectively.




       The magnetic field used to obtain the B flux is the instantaneous
       B, for instantaneous data; for spin period data, it is the spin
       period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Threshold for |B|.




       There are plot menus containing plots of B flux.

       In addition, it is possible to create "on the fly" plots of this
       quantity.


       The procedure for creating an "on the fly" plot is as follows:

        1) At least 1 component of the E to be used must be plotted.
           At least 1 component of the B to be used must be plotted.

        2) Click the right mouse button on the plot of a component of E.
           In the menu that appears, select "Operations".
           In the menu that appears, select "B Flux".

        3) If the plot chosen has more than 1 line plot ("trace") in it,
           a box appears where 1 trace is to be chosen (click left mouse
           button), for a component of E.

        4) A box appears where 1 quantity is to be chosen (click left
           mouse button), for B.

        5) Click the left mouse button on the "Compute" button.


       It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that:

        1) The plot or trace selected for a component of E does, indeed,
           correspond to a component of an electric field.

        2) The quantity selected for B does, indeed, correspond to a
           magnetic field.

        3) The components of E and B both refer to the same orientation
           of coordinate system axes.

    4.10 Angles between the electric field spin plane instrument
         booms and the magnetic field.





       There are 2 angles that can be determined:


            1) The angle between the 12 boom and the B vector.


            2) The angle between the 34 boom and the B vector.




       The 12 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 1.


       The 34 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 3.




       It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on the
       spin plane; but B is a full, 3-dimensional vector, and its spin
       plane and its spin axis components are used in these
       calculations.




       The magnetic field used to determine the angles is the
       instantaneous B.




       The same threshold value for |B| that is used in the selection of
       data points for the instantaneous and burst electric fields, is
       used also in the computation of the angles between the electric
       field spin plane instrument booms and the magnetic field: the
       values of the angles are considered to be undefined if |B| is
       less than the threshold.

       This is because if |B| is very small, the direction of the
       B vector may be considered to be poorly defined.




       The determination of the angles can be done at any desired time
       resolution.




       Most important user parameters:

           Time resolution for the angles.

           Threshold for |B|.

    4.11 Angles between the electric field spin plane instrument
         booms and the Sun vector.





       There are 2 angles that can be determined:


            1) The angle between the 12 boom and the Sun vector.


            2) The angle between the 34 boom and the Sun vector.




       The 12 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 1.


       The 34 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 3.




       The Sun vector S is the vector that points from the center of the
       Earth to the Sun.




       It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on the
       spin plane; but S is a full, 3-dimensional vector, and its spin
       plane and its spin axis components are used in these
       calculations.




       The determination of the angles can be done at any desired time
       resolution.




       Most important user parameters:

           Time resolution for the angles.

    4.12 Electric field FAC component ratios.





       These are the ratios


           EZ / EX

           EZ / EY


       where E is in Field-Aligned Coordinates; i.e., the ratios of

           E_parallel / E_perpendicular.




       The ratios are not well defined if the denominators are too
       small.


       The user can specify a lower limit for the absolute value of the
       denominator.




       If a denominator has an absolute value that is less than the
       lower limit, it is possible either to consider the corresponding
       ratio to be undefined (i.e., no data point is produced); or the
       ratio can be set to a very large value (which can be positive or
       negative).


       The user can specify whether to skip the data point for a small
       denominator, or to set a huge value.




       Since there are 3 versions of the electric field, namely, E, E_0,
       and E_Dot0; therefore, 2 corresponding versions of the component
       ratios are defined as well, depending on the version of the
       electric field that is used in the calculation (E or E_0).


       No component ratios are plotted for E_Dot0 (for E_Dot0, the FAC Z
       component is zero by definition).




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       and spin period FAC component ratios; are the instantaneous,
       burst, and spin period data, respectively.




       Most important user parameters:

           Action for small denominator (skip / huge value).

           Minimum |denominator|.

    4.13 Quality flag for spacecraft potentials.





       The quality flag for spacecraft potentials is a measure of the
       difference between the spin plane spacecraft potentials


           S_C_Pot12

           S_C_Pot34




       The user can specify a maximum difference, and a factor for
       maximum difference.




       If either:

            1) The absolute difference

               |S_C_Pot12 - S_C_Pot34|

       is less than or equal to the maximum difference;

       or:

            2) The absolute difference

               |S_C_Pot12 - S_C_Pot34|

       is less than or equal to the product of: the factor for maximum
       difference, times the largest of

               |S_C_Pot12|

               |S_C_Pot34|


       then the flag is "good" (0);


       otherwise, the flag is "bad" (1).




       The spacecraft potential data used to obtain the instantaneous
       and spin period quality flag; are the instantaneous and spin
       period data, respectively.




       Most important user parameters:

           Maximum difference.

           Factor for maximum difference.

    4.14 Quality flag for large electric field values.





       The quality flag for large electric field values is a measure of
       the number of input data points for the raw electric field spin
       plane components, that have large values.




       The user can specify a maximum value, and a maximum number of bad
       data points.




       A count is made of the number of data points for the
       instantaneous V12L and V34L that have absolute value larger than
       the maximum value, within a time interval.


       For instantaneous data, the time interval is the time interval
       between data points of the instantaneous voltage V1L.


       For spin period data, the time interval is the spin period.




       If the number of data points for V12L and V34L with large values
       in the time interval, is less than or equal to the maximum number
       of bad data points,


       then the flag is "good" (0);


       otherwise, the flag is "bad" (1).




       Most important user parameters:

           Maximum value.

           Maximum number of bad data points.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.15 Selected spacecraft potentials.





       Points for spacecraft potentials can be selected according to the
       values of one or more quality flags.



       Points are selected if all the quality flags are "good", and
       rejected otherwise.




       For the selection designated as

           QF_1

       the following quality flags are used:

            1) Quality flag for spacecraft potentials.




       For the selection designated as

           QF_2

       the following quality flags are used:

            1) Quality flag for spacecraft potentials.

            2) Quality flag for large electric field values.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.16 Quality flags for the electric field.





       The "electric field quality flag 002" is determined by inspecting
       data in time intervals of equal duration ("computation time
       interval").



       The following are determined for each computation interval:



        1) Standard deviation of the DSC_X component of the electric
           field at spin period time resolution, "34".

           Standard deviation of the DSC_X component of the electric
           field at spin period time resolution, "12".



           Ratio_E_X =

             (SD of the X component of E_34) /

             (SD of the X component of E_12)



           Diff_E_X =

             (SD of the X component of E_34) -

             (SD of the X component of E_12)



        2) Standard deviation of the DSC_Y component of the electric
           field at spin period time resolution, "34".

           Standard deviation of the DSC_Y component of the electric
           field at spin period time resolution, "12".



           Ratio_E_Y =

             (SD of the Y component of E_34) /

             (SD of the Y component of E_12)



           Diff_E_Y =

             (SD of the Y component of E_34) -

             (SD of the Y component of E_12)



        3) The quality flag Q is determined as follows (where K1, K2,
           K3, K4, K5, K6, are values specified by the user):



            1) If


               K2 <= |Ratio_E_X| <= K3  and

               K2 <= |Ratio_E_Y| <= K3


               then Q is set for "Quality level 1, ratios".



            2) Otherwise, if


               (K4 <= |Ratio_E_X| <= K2  and

                |Diff_E_X| >= K5) or


               (K4 <= |Ratio_E_Y| <= K2  and

                |Diff_E_Y| >= K5) or


               (K3 <= |Ratio_E_X| <= K6  and

                |Diff_E_X| >= K5) or


               (K3 <= |Ratio_E_Y| <= K6  and

                |Diff_E_Y| >= K5)


               then Q is set for "Quality level 2".



            3) Otherwise, if


               (|Ratio_E_X| <= K4  and

                |Diff_E_X| >= K5) or


               (|Ratio_E_Y| <= K4  and

                |Diff_E_Y| >= K5) or


               (|Ratio_E_X| >= K6  and

                |Diff_E_X| >= K5) or


               (|Ratio_E_Y| >= K6  and

                |Diff_E_Y| >= K5)


               then Q is set for "Quality level 3".



            4) Otherwise,


               then Q is set for "Quality level 1, small fields".



        4) For the quality flag to be determined, a minimum number of
           data points is required.  Also, it is required that the
           denominators of the ratios not be too close to zero (the
           absolute value of each denominator must be >= K1).



           If these conditions are not met, then the quality flag is set
           to a "filler value" (99.0).




       Most important user parameters:

           Duration of the computation time interval.

           Minimum number of points required for each input (points per
           minute).

           Parameters K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6.

           Values to be assigned to the quality flag for each quality
           level.
