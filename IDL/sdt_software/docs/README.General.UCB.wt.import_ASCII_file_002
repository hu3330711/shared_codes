   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module creates an SDT quantity from an ASCII input
       file.





    2) There are no SDT inputs.





    3) The user has the option of not having an input file at all.



       If there is no input file, then the SDT output has zero data
       data points.





    4) All the times in the file must be referred to the same date.



       Therefore, times could go over 86,400 seconds (and could be
       negative).





    5) The user can designate a limit for the length of an input line.



       This limit refers to the largest number of characters allowed for
       a line (not counting the "newline" or end of line character, or a
       possible "carriage return").





    6) The user can designate special "comment characters", that make
       lines from the input file be treated as comment lines.



       A line is considered a comment line if its first (or only)
       non-white space character is one of the "comment characters".


       Other types of comment lines are described below.





    7) The user can designate a coefficient A, and offsets B, C, D; and
       a coefficient a(i), and offsets b(i), c(i), d(i), for each input
       data component ("i" represents an input data component index).



       If the input value for data component i is x(i), then the
       corresponding output value y(i) is determined as follows:


           y(i) = A * {a(i) * [x(i) - b(i) - B] - c(i) - C} - d(i) - D





    8) An output data point is produced for each data point in the
       input file; provided that it is within the time interval
       specified to SDT.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as the time
       tag for the corresponding input data point.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                   0     =  Do not dump.

                   >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                            0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                            dump frequency).



            2) Flag for the input file.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                   WT_TRUE   =  There is an input file.

                   WT_FALSE  =  There is no input file.



            3) Directory for the input file.


               Char.


               If there is an input file, then
               must be a valid directory (not blank).



            4) File name for the input file.


               Char.


               This is the file name only (no path).


               If there is an input file, then
               must be a valid file name (not blank), and
               the file must exist.



            5) Maximum number of characters for an input line.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  0.



            6) Comment characters.


               Char.


               The character string must consist of non-white-space
               characters (at least 1).



            7) Flag for the date to which the time in the file is
               referred.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                   WT_TRUE   =  The date is the SDT start date.


                   WT_FALSE  =  The date is not the SDT start date.


               The SDT start date is the start date for the time
               interval to be processed by SDT.



            8) Date to which the time in the file is referred.


               Char.


               If the flag for the date is "false", then
               must be a valid date in the format YYYY/MM/DD (e.g.,
               1996/05/29).



            9) Number of data quantities for each data point.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



           10) Coefficient A.


               Double.



           11) Offset B.


               Double.



           12) Offset C.


               Double.



           13) Offset D.


               Double.



           14) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each data quantity.



                1) The group of parameters described here occurs once
                   for each of the following values, in succession:

                   Coefficient a.

                   Offset b.

                   Offset c.

                   Offset d.



                    1) "Fill code" for the parameter.


                       Int.


                       This code indicates how to fill the "final" value
                       for the parameter (i.e., the value that will be
                       actually used).


                       Must be one of the following:


                           WT_SM_PARM_USR       =
                               Set the final value from the "user" value
                               for this parameter for this quantity
                               (i.e., the value entered by the user).


                           WT_SM_PARM_COPY_USR  =
                               Set the final value by copying the user
                               value from another quantity.


                           WT_SM_PARM_COPY_VAL  =
                               Set the final value by copying the final
                               value from another quantity.


                       If the final parameter value is copied from a
                       value for a different quantity, then the user
                       value for the current data quantity (entered
                       below) is ignored.

                       The copy is made from the appropriate value for
                       the corresponding parameter for the other
                       quantity (e.g., the value for "a" for the current
                       data quantity is copied from a value for "a" from
                       the other data quantity).



                    2) "Copy" index for the parameter.


                       Int.


                       This is the index of the quantity from which to
                       copy a value, for the final value of the present
                       quantity.


                       If the "fill code" is to copy the final parameter
                       value, from a value for a different quantity,
                       then
                       must be  >=  0  and  <  the index for the
                       "current data quantity" (the data quantity for
                       which the parameter values are to be set).

                       The first data quantity has index 0.



                    3) Parameter value.


                       Double.


                       This is the "user" value for the parameter.





    4) The following input data files are used:



            1) The file with the input data.


               This file is an ASCII file.


               The following are considered to be comment lines:

                1) Empty lines.

                2) Lines with only white space (spaces and/or tabs).

                3) Lines whose first (or only) non-white space character
                   is a designated "comment character".


               Each line not a comment line contains one data point.


               Fields within each line must be separated by white space,
               and are not restricted to fixed character positions.


               The fields must be as follows:


                1) Time.

                   Real.

                   This is time in seconds, since 0 hours UT of the
                   designated date.


                2) One or more additional fields, one for the value of
                   each data quantity for the data point.

                   Real.


               The lines should be in sequence of increasing time.

               This is not checked, but if not true may lead to
               incorrect results.


               No line should be longer than the designated limit.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



           None.





    6) The SDT output data quantity is a time series (Standard data
       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) One component for each input data quantity value.


               Float.
