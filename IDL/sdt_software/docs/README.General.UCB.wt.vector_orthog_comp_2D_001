   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces the components of a vector in 2D,
       along 2 orthogonal directions; from the orthogonal projections of
       the vector along 2 arbitrary directions (not necessarily
       orthogonal).



       The 2 directions with the known projections, and the 2 orthogonal
       directions for which the components are desired; must all be on
       the same plane.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) First projection of the vector.



            2) Second projection of the vector.





    3) The 2 directions for which the projections are known, must not be
       along the same line on the plane (same or opposite direction).



       The calculation involves a denominator, which is the sine of the
       angle between these 2 directions.





    4) There is a "basic" line on the plane; every azimuth is an angle
       on the plane, measured from this "basic" line.



       There is a reference line on the plane.



       Each azimuth is made up of the sum of the azimuth of the
       reference line with respect to the "basic" line, plus an
       additional part; the sum, then, is azimuth with respect to the
       "basic" line.



       The user can specify: the azimuth of each direction for which the
       projection is known; and the azimuth of the first of the
       directions for which the component is desired.



       The azimuth of the second of the directions for which the
       component is desired, must be either 90 degrees more or 90
       degrees less than that for the first direction for which the
       component is desired (modulo 360 degrees).





    5) The user can specify a separate factor for each vector projection
       value, to allow for the possibility that the input value is in
       the opposite direction than is needed.



       Each factor must be either +1 (same direction) or -1 (opposite
       direction).



       The value of a vector projection is related to the corresponding
       input value as follows:


           Vector projection = (Direction factor) * (Input value)





    6) An output data point is produced for each successful match
       containing a data point of each of the following inputs:

            1) The first projection of the vector.

            2) The second projection of the vector.



       The time tag for the output data point is a weighted average of
       the time tags of the input data points participating in the
       match.



       The weights for the average for the output time tag are specified
       by the user.

       All the weights must be zero or positive.





    7) The user can specify a separate maximum time separation for each
       input to be matched; larger time separations between consecutive
       input data points are considered to be data dropouts.





    8) The user can specify a tolerance factor for the time matching.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:

                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
