   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces a running average for a single
       scalar quantity.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) The input for the scalar to be averaged.





    3) The user can choose the number N of input data points to be
       averaged.





    4) For an output data point to be produced, it is required that
       there be N consecutive input data points, with no time gaps.





    5) Absence of data gaps means that the time between consecutive
       input data points is close to a constant time separation.



       In other words, the N input data points to be averaged must all
       be consecutive input data points of the same time series skein,
       within a time series regime with consistent sampling rate.





    6) For the scalar input to be averaged, there is the option of
       specifying limits and ignoring data values beyond the limits.





    7) When there are N consecutive input data points with no time gaps,
       the output value is determined.



       The output value is computed as the average of the N input data
       values.





    8) The time tag for the output data point is the average of the time
       tags of the first and the last input data points in the average.





    9) For an output data point to be produced, the entire set of N
       input data points must fit within the total time interval being
       processed.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Number of input data points per average.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            3) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               the input scalar value.



                1) Flag for limits.


                   Int.


                   Must be one of the following:


                       WT_TRUE   =  Use limits for input values.

                       WT_FALSE  =  Do not use limits for input values.



                2) Lower limit.


                   Double.



                3) Upper limit.


                   Double.



               If the flag for limits is true, then
               the lower limit  must be  <=  the upper limit.



                4) Input component index.


                   Int.



            4) i_nskips.


               Int.


               Parameter for sampling history.



            5) i_consist.


               Int.

            6) i_srate_fuzz.


               Double.


               Parameter for sampling history.



            7) i_max_t_diff.

               Int.


               Parameter for sampling history.



            9) i_show_only_consistent.


               Int.


               Parameter for sampling history.



           10) i_hist_alg_code.


               Int.


               Parameter for sampling history.





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



            1) The input to be averaged.


               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.

                   Double.

                   Must be component 0.

    6) The SDT output data quantity is a time series (Standard data
       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.

            2) Value of the output scalar.
