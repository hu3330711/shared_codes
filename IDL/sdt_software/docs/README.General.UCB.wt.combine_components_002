   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module combines components of 2 input quantities,
       using functions of 2 variables.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



        1) The primary input.



        2) The secondary input.





    3) 1 or more input data components of the primary input can be
       selected to be used, as the 1st. argument to the functions of 2
       variables.



       1 input data component of the secondary input can be selected to
       be used, as the 2nd. argument to the functions of 2 variables.





    4) Each output data quantity is a combination of a selected data
       component from the primary input, and the selected data component
       from the secondary input.





    5) Each data component from the primary input that is selected must
       be used to generate at least 1 output data quantity.





    6) There can be any number of output data quantities; the minimum is
       1.





    7) The functions that can be used are contained in the
       general-purpose function Gen_F_2_Var_001.





    8) Each combination of 2 input components is used to create
       ultimately an output quantity.



       Different output quantities can use different function codes.





    9) For each output quantity, the output value from Gen_F_2_Var_001
       is used as input to the general-purpose function Gen_F_1_Var_001.



       Different output quantities can use different function codes.



       The value of the output quantity is the output value from
       Gen_F_1_Var_001.





   10) For each selected data component of the primary input, there is
       the option of specifying limits and ignoring data values beyond
       the limits.



       An input data point of the primary input is considered only if
       all the selected data components have valid values.





   11) For the selected data component of the secondary input, there is
       the option of specifying limits and ignoring data values beyond
       the limits.



       An input data point of the secondary input is considered only if
       the selected data component has valid values.





   12) An output data point is produced for each input data point of the
       primary input; provided that all of the output quantities can be
       produced.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input data point of the primary input.





   13) For an output data point to be produced, the primary input data
       point must be in the time interval defined by two input data
       points of the secondary input.



       The user can specify whether the value of the selected data
       component of the secondary input, for the time of the primary
       input data point, is obtained by linear interpolation or by
       replication.



       However, if the time interval between the two input data points
       is larger than a chosen value, this is considered to be a data
       dropout.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0      =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1   =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                              dump frequency); i.e., every n-th point.

                    <= -1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-1)  (where -n is the
                              chosen dump frequency); i.e., the first n
                              points.



            2) Number of output data quantities.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.

               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            4) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the primary input data quantities used.



                1) Flag for limits.


                   Int.


                   Must be one of the following:


                       WT_TRUE   =  Use limits for input values.

                3) Upper limit.


                   Double.



               If the flag for limits is true, then
               the lower limit  must be  <=  the upper limit.



                4) Input component index.


                   Int.



            5) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               the secondary input data quantity used.



                1) Dropout time.


                   Double.


                   Units are seconds.


                   Must be  >  0.



                2) Flag for limits.


                   Int.


                   Must be one of the following:


                       WT_TRUE   =  Use limits for input values.

                       WT_FALSE  =  Do not use limits for input values.



                3) Lower limit.


                   Double.



                4) Upper limit.


                   Double.



               If the flag for limits is true, then
               the lower limit  must be  <=  the upper limit.



                5) Flag to interpolate.

                6) Input component index.


                   Int.



            6) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the output data quantities.



                1) Input component index for input variable 1.


                   Int.



                2) Flag for the same functions and auxiliary parameters
                   as the first output data quantity.

                   Must be one of the following:


                       WT_TRUE   =  Use the same.

                       WT_FALSE  =  Do not use the same.



                   This flag occurs only for the 2nd. and for each
                   subsequent output data quantity, not for the 1st.

                   If the flag for an output data quantity is true, then
                   the rest of the parameters in this group does not
                   occur for that output data quantity.



                3) Code for the function of 2 variables.

                   Int.


                   The exact number depends on the function code, and
                   can be zero.



                5) Auxiliary double parameters for the function of 2
                   variables.
