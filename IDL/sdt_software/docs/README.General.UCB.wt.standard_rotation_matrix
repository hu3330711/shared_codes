   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces a rotation matrix between two
       standard coordinate systems.





    2) The coordinate systems between which a matrix can be produced are
       the following:


            1) GEI  =  Geocentric Equatorial Inertial.

            2) GSE  =  Geocentric Solar Ecliptic.

            3) GSM  =  Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric.



       See the user parameters below for a list of the matrices that can
       be produced.





    3) There are no inputs.



       The rotation matrix is determined solely by the time.





    4) A matrix that rotates from system A to system B will transform
       vector components from system A to system B:


           Matrix * [Vector in system A] = [Vector in system B]





    5) The matrices produced by this Science Module are for rotation in
       one direction only.



       The matrix for the rotation in the opposite direction is the
       transpose of the matrix produced.





    6) The time resolution can be specified.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Code for the coordinate systems in the rotation.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    1  =  Rotation from GEI to GSE.

                    2  =  Rotation from GEI to GSM.

                    3  =  Rotation from GSE to GSM.



            3) Time resolution for the output.


               Double.


               Units are seconds.


               Must be  >  0.





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following input data quantities:



           None.





    6) The output data quantity is a time series (Standard data type)
       and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) a(1,1).


               Double.



            3) a(1,2).


               Double.



            4) a(1,3).


               Double.



            5) a(2,1).


               Double.



            6) a(2,2).


               Double.



            7) a(2,3).


               Double.



            8) a(3,1).


               Double.



            9) a(3,2).


               Double.



           10) a(3,3).


               Double.



       Note: The matrix is designated "a", with rows and columns
       numbered 1 to 3; the first subscript is the row number, the
       second subscript is the column number.
