   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces the product of two matrices in 3D.



       One of the matrices is designated as the primary matrix.





    2) There must be the following inputs:



            1) The primary matrix.



            2) The secondary matrix.





    3) The output matrix is calculated as follows:


       Either


           Primary_Matrix * Secondary_Matrix


       or


           Secondary_Matrix * Primary_Matrix


       depending on the user's choice.





    4) At the user's option, the transpose of either input matrix can be
       used in the calculation instead of the input matrix itself.



       This replacement of using the transpose instead of the input
       matrix can be done simultaneously for both input matrices.





    5) An output data point is produced for each input primary matrix.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input primary matrix.





    6) For an output data point to be produced, the input primary matrix
       must be in the interval defined by two input data points for the
       secondary matrix.



       The secondary matrix for the time of the output data point is the
       input secondary matrix at the closest time available.



       However, if the time interval between the two input data points
       for the secondary matrix is larger than a chosen value, this is
       considered to be a data dropout.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Code for the order of the product.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    1  =  Compute Primary_Matrix * Secondary_Matrix.

                    2  =  Compute Secondary_Matrix * Primary_Matrix.



            3) Flag to transpose the primary matrix.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    WT_TRUE   =  Transpose.

                    WT_FALSE  =  Do not transpose.



            4) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the 9 primary input matrix components.



                1) Input component index.


                   Int.


                   The indices must correspond to the matrix elements in
                   row-major order (column subscript varies fastest).



            5) Flag to transpose the secondary matrix.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    WT_TRUE   =  Transpose.

                    WT_FALSE  =  Do not transpose.



            6) Dropout time for the secondary matrix.


               Double.


               Units are seconds.


               Must be  >  0.
