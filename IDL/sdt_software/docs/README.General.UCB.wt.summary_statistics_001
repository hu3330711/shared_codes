   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module determines the summary statistics for a
       number of data quantities.



       The data quantities are scalar (float) quantities.



       There can be any number of data quantities; different quantities
       may come from the same or from different inputs.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



        1) The data inputs containing the data quantities.





    3) The summary statistics for a quantity are:


        1) Number of values.


        2) Minimum value.


        3) Maximum value.


        4) Mean.


        5) Standard deviation.



       These summary statistics refer to the entire time interval used
       in SDT to call the Science Module.



       For each quantity, the user can specify which of the statistics
       (or all) should be output.





    4) The Science Module writes 1 single line to an output file; this
       line contains the following:


        1) Start date and time for the time interval.


        2) End date and time for the time interval.


        3) The summary statistics chosen to be output for the 1st. data
           quantity.


        4) The summary statistics chosen to be output for the 2nd. data
           quantity.


       etc.





    5) The Science Module does not write any output data points to an
       SDT output, as the object of the Science Module is to create the
       line written to the output file, containing the summary
       statistics.



       However, an SDT output does exist, to satisfy the formal
       requirements of SDT.





    6) The minimum number of data quantities is 1.



       Each data quantity comes from a data component of a data input.


       Each data input must be used; i.e., at least 1 data component of
       the input must provide a data quantity to be used.


       It is permissible for 2 or more different data quantities to have
       the same input or different inputs; if the same input, it is
       permissible for them  to have the same component or different
       components.





    7) For the output file, there is the choice of appending to an
       existing file, or overwriting it.





    8) For each data quantity, there is the option of specifying limits
       for the input values, and ignoring data values beyond the limits.





    9) If limits are specified for a data quantity, and if an input data
       point has a value for that quantity that is beyond the limits;
       then that value is ignored in the process of determining the
       summary statistics for that quantity.



       However, if some other quantity also comes from the same input,
       and if that 2nd. quantity does not have limits specified (or the
       value for the 2nd. quantity is within its limits); then the input
       data point value for the 2nd. quantity is used and is not
       ignored.





   10) The number of values will always be available; however, other
       summary statistics can require a minimum number of valid values.



       The user can specify a "filler value" for each data quantity, to
       be output in place of any requested statistic that is not
       available due to an insufficient number of valid values.





   11) The user can specify the formats to be used to output the
       summary statistics.



       Each format must be specified as a C format (such as would be
       used by the function "fprintf"); can contain blank spaces; and
       must be preceded and followed by slashes (/).



       Note that the format must not be enclosed in double quotes; and
       note also that the enclosing slashes are stripped off before the
       format is used.



       An example of an appropriate parameter value for a format:

           /%12d/

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



        1) Number of data inputs.


           Int.


           Must be  >=  1.



        2) Number of data quantities.


           Int.


           Must be  >=  the number of data inputs, as each data
           input must be used for at least one data quantity but can be
           used for more than one.



        3) Directory for the output file.


           Char.


           Must be a valid directory (not blank).



        4) File name for the output file.


           Char.


           This is the file name only (no path).


           Must be a valid file name (not blank).



        5) Flag to append to an existing output file.


           Int.


           Must be one of the following:


               WT_TRUE   =  Append to the file.

               WT_FALSE  =  Do not append to the file (overwrite).



        6) "code".


           Int.


           Parameter for formatting date and time.



        7) "nsp_1".
