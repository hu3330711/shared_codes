   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces the product of two matrices in 3D.



       The product can be produced at any time resolution.





    2) There must be the following inputs:



            1) The first matrix.



            2) The second matrix.





    3) The output matrix is calculated as follows:


           Matrix_1 * Matrix_2





    4) At the user's option, the transpose of either input matrix can be
       used in the calculation instead of the input matrix itself.



       This replacement of using the transpose instead of the input
       matrix can be done simultaneously for both input matrices.





    5) The time resolution can be specified.





    6) For an output data point to be produced, it must be in the time
       interval defined by two input data points for Matrix_1, and also
       in the time interval defined by two input data points for
       Matrix_2.



       The Matrix_1 for the time of the output data point is the input
       Matrix_1 at the closest time available.

       However, if the time interval between the two input data points
       for the Matrix_1 is larger than a chosen value, this is
       considered to be a data dropout.



       The Matrix_2 for the time of the output data point is the input
       Matrix_2 at the closest time available.

       However, if the time interval between the two input data points
       for the Matrix_2 is larger than a chosen value, this is
       considered to be a data dropout.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Time resolution for the output.


               Double.


               Units are seconds.


               Must be  >  0.



            3) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the two input matrices.



                1) Flag to transpose the matrix.


                   Int.


                   Must be one of the following:


                        WT_TRUE   =  Transpose.

                        WT_FALSE  =  Do not transpose.



                2) Dropout time for the matrix.


                   Double.


                   Units are seconds.


                   Must be  >  0.



                3) The group of parameters described here occurs once
                   for each of the 9 input matrix components.


                    1) Input component index.


                       Int.


                       The indices must correspond to the matrix
                       elements in row-major order (column subscript
                       varies fastest).





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following input data quantities:

               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.

               type); the following components are required, and must be

       Note: The matrix is designated "a", with rows and columns
       numbered 1 to 3; the first subscript is the row number, the
       second subscript is the column number.
