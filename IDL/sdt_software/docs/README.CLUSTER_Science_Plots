    1. Introduction.





       This document describes plots of Science quantities that are
available for CLUSTER data.



       In order to display these plots, one can use the program "sdt".





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2. Types of plots.





       The program "sdt" can be used to create several types of plots.



       While this document is concerned with Science plots only, it is
helpful to have some understanding of all the plot types and how they
are related.



       The various types of plots are described in the sections that
follow.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2.1 Raw quantities.





       Generally speaking, CLUSTER raw quantities are created by a
program (part of "sdt") called the CLUSTER Decommutator, using as input
mainly the following:

           Level zero electric field data.

           Level zero magnetic field data.

           Orbit data.

           Attitude data.

           Level zero Housekeeping data.

           Data from the Cluster Active Archive.



       When a plot of a raw quantity is produced, in general the user
has no control on how the quantity is determined; i.e., there are no
parameters to be used in the calculation, that the user could adjust.

       There are exceptions to this, however; in other words, there can
be raw quantities, produced by the CLUSTER Decommutator, for which there
may be parameters that the user can adjust.



       It should be noted that the name "Raw" is used here only to
indicate that the quantity is produced by the CLUSTER Decommutator.  In
fact, Raw quantities may have undergone a significant degree of
processing (calibrations, etc.).





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2.2 Science quantities.





       CLUSTER Science quantities are produced by one of a number of
programs (also part of "sdt") known collectively as Science Modules,
using as input:

           Raw quantities.

           Other Science quantities.



       The creation of a Science quantity will always require running
the CLUSTER Decommutator; but because Science Modules can use Science
quantities as inputs to create other Science quantities, the creation of
a Science quantity may involve a number of Science Modules running to
produce intermediate Science quantities.



       When a plot of a Science quantity is produced, there may be user
parameters to be used in the calculation, that the user could adjust.
       When this is the case, the user is prompted for the values of the
parameters.
       Furthermore, after the plot is completed, the user can change
parameter values and have "sdt" recompute the Science quantity and
display a new plot.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    2.3 Special SSL Science quantities.





       CLUSTER Special SSL Science quantities are Science quantities,
just like the ones described before.



       However, these quantities are kept in a separate plot menu,
because they are intended for special use at SSL: for diagnostics,
special projects, etc.  SSL stands for the University of California,
Berkeley, Space Sciences Laboratory.



       Users interested in of any of these plots can get more
information from SSL.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3. General information on Science quantity plots.





       The information in this section is helpful to a better
understanding of all the Science plots.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.1 Time resolution.





       For magnetic field data, there are 2 time resolutions:



           1) Instantaneous.

              This is usually about 25 data points per second.



           2) Spin period.

              This results from a least-squares spin fit of the
              instantaneous data; there is about 1 data point per 4
              seconds.




       For electric field data, there are 4 time resolutions:



           1) Instantaneous.

              This is usually about 25 data points per second for V12,
              V34 (although occasionally there may be 450 data points
              per second for V12, V34); and about 5 data points per
              second for V1, V2, V3, V4.



           2) Burst.

              This is from 450 data points per second to 36000 data
              points per second.



           3) Spin period.

              This results from a least-squares spin fit of the
              instantaneous data; there is about 1 data point per 4
              seconds.



           4) Housekeeping spin fits.

              The electric field data at the time resolutions described
              above (Instantaneous, Burst, Spin period) is obtained from
              data transmitted from the spacecraft as Science data.

              The least-squares spin fit for the Spin period data is
              computed on the ground.

              By contrast, the electric field data in the Housekeeping
              spin fits is transmitted from the spacecraft as
              Housekeeping data; this data includes values for a spin
              fit computed on board the spacecraft.

              There should be one data point for every spin period,
              i.e., about 1 data point per 4 seconds.  In fact, the
              data that can be transmitted is slightly less, so that
              1 spin period out of about every 4 or 5 is missing.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.2 Types of electric field instrument output.





       There are the following types of electric field instrument
       output, depending on the applicable band-pass filter:

           L = Low.

           M = Medium.

           H = High.

           U = Unfiltered.



       It should be noted that electric field data of some types may not
       be present for some time resolutions.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.3 Names of burst plots.





       The name of each burst plot generally contains the letter B.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.4 Names of spin period plots.





       The name of each spin period plot generally contains the letter
       A, to indicate that it is an average.



       The name also contains one of the following:


           12

           34



       The spin fit of V12 and the spin fit of V34 are performed
       starting at different phase angles within the spin period.

       Therefore, the two spin fits have different time tags.



       For spin period electric field data that could come from either
       the instantaneous V12 or the instantaneous V34; "12" or "34"
       indicates which of the two sets of instantaneous data was used to
       generate the spin period data.



       For other spin period electric field data, and for spin period
       magnetic field data; "12" or "34" indicates which of the two sets
       of time tags applies.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.5 Names of housekeeping spin fit plots.





       The name of each housekeeping spin fit plot generally contains
       the letters HKSF.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.6 Coordinate systems.





       The coordinate systems used for CLUSTER are documented elsewhere.




       The main coordinate systems for Science plots are:


           GSE = Geocentric Solar Ecliptic.


           GSM = Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric.


           FAC = Field-Aligned Coordinates.




       For FAC, there are really 3 different coordinate systems,
       depending on the magnetic field used to define them:


           FAC_I, defined by the instantaneous magnetic field.


           FAC_S, defined by the spin period magnetic field.


           FAC_M, defined by the model magnetic field.




       While in principle any FAC coordinate system can be used for any
       data, in practice these coordinate systems are used as follows:


           FAC_I  is used for instantaneous and for burst data.


           FAC_S  is used for spin period and for housekeeping spin fit
                  data.


           FAC_M  is used for all data (instantaneous, burst, spin
                  period, housekeeping spin fit).




       Other coordinate systems for Science plots are:


           BSC = Magnetic Spacecraft Coordinates.

                 Analogously to FAC, there are BSC_I, BSC_S, BSC_M.


           GEI = Geocentric Equatorial Inertial.

                 Also designated ECI, or GCI.




       All the coordinate systems above are non-rotating; i.e., they do
       not participate in the rotation of the spacecraft.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.7 Minimum time span for plots.





       In general, Science plots require the use of auxiliary quantities
       (attitude, spin pulse, etc.); these quantities are fetched
       automatically by "sdt" when needed.



       For a point to be plotted, it must be in the time interval
       defined by 2 data points for the attitude, if the attitude is
       needed; and it must be in the time interval defined by 2 data
       points for the spin pulse, if the spin pulse is needed; etc.



       Of these auxiliary quantities, the one with the most coarse time
       resolution within "sdt" is the attitude.  In "sdt", the attitude
       has one data point every 600 seconds; they occur exactly on the
       hour, on the hour + 10 minutes, etc.



       Therefore, it is best to request a time interval that begins a
       little before the last multiple of 10 minutes preceding the data
       to be plotted; and that ends a little after the first multiple of
       10 minutes following the data to be plotted.



       For example, if the data to be plotted is for the time interval

           04:27:30 - 04:32:10

       then it would be advisable to request an interval such as

           04:19:00 - 04:41:00

       (or simply  04:19 - 04:41 , as "sdt" assumes the seconds to be
       zero if omitted).



       Another example: if the data to be plotted is for the time
       interval

           04:20:00 - 04:40:00

       then it would be advisable to request the same interval as in
       the previous example, i.e.,

           04:19 - 04:41




       Note that, once a plot has been produced, one can always use the
       Zoom function of "sdt" to look at a smaller time interval.




       Another reason to extend the time interval is that the
       processing of important quantities (such as the magnetic field
       and the electric field) can include the computation of averages
       over a number of spin periods; these computations cannot be
       performed near the beginning and the end of the time interval.

       An extra "padding" of 10 to 30 minutes at each end should be
       amply sufficient in most cases.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.8 Electric field quantities and magnetic field.





       We can think of the process of creating a plot of a vector
       quantity related to the electric field, as consisting of 2 parts:



           1) Determination of the vector quantity itself.



           2) Rotation of the vector quantity into the desired
              coordinate system.




       Examples of such vector quantities include: the various versions
       of E itself; the "transformed" E, or E_T; and the ExB plasma
       velocity v.




       The determination of the vector quantity may involve the use of
       the magnetic field:



           1) The angles between the electric field instrument booms and
              B, and the latitude of B with respect to the spin plane;
              can be used to select data points for the instantaneous
              and the burst spin plane components of E.



           2) B may appear in the calculation of the vector quantity (e.
              g., to determine the spin axis component of E_Dot0; to
              determine the VxB correction for E_T; or to calculate v).



       The magnetic field used to determine these vector quantities is
       always the measured magnetic field; this document specifies in
       each case whether the B used is the instantaneous B or the spin
       period B.




       Once the vector quantity has been obtained, it can be plotted in
       any one of a number of coordinate systems, such as GSE or GSM.



       If the choice is made to plot the vector quantity in a coordinate
       system such as FAC, then the magnetic field is involved once
       again, in the definition of the coordinate system.



       However, depending on the FAC system chosen, the magnetic field
       used to define the coordinate system may be the same that was
       used when obtaining the vector quantity, or may be different.



       For example, the magnetic field involved in obtaining the
       instantaneous E_Dot0 is the instantaneous B.

       If the instantaneous E_Dot0 is plotted in FAC_I, then the
       instantaneous B is used again, to define the coordinate system.

       If, on the other hand, the instantaneous E_Dot0 is plotted in
       FAC_M, then the model B is used to define the coordinate system.
       So, in this case we use first the instantaneous B to calculate
       E_Dot0, and then we use the model B to define the coordinate
       system into which to rotate that previously calculated E_Dot0.




       The situation can be more complicated in the case of spin period
       time resolution.

       As an extreme example, if we want to plot the spin period E_Dot0
       in FAC_M, then we use the following versions of B:

           1) Instantaneous B, to select data points for the
              instantaneous spin plane components of E.

           2) Spin period B, to calculate the spin axis component of
              E_Dot0.

           3) Model B, to define the coordinate system for the plot.




       The quantities E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0 are exceptions to the above; this
       is because these quantities are defined in terms of one
       particular FAC coordinate system.

       For these quantities, then, the same B is involved automatically
       in defining the coordinate system, and in obtaining the quantity.

       For example, the magnetic field involved in obtaining the burst
       E_X0 is the instantaneous B.

       Here, too, we can have a more complicated situation in the case
       of spin period time resolution.  The spin period E_X0 involves
       the instantaneous B, in the selection of data points for the
       instantaneous spin plane components of E; and then, it involves
       the spin period B, in the definition of the coordinate system and
       in the determination of the spin axis component of E_X0.




       The plasma potential is a scalar quantity, so the issue of which
       coordinate system to plot it in does not arise.

       However, the plasma potential is defined by E and ds (the
       element of distance traveled by the spacecraft), both of which
       are vectors, and both of which are required by the definition to
       be in a particular FAC coordinate system.

       Therefore, after E has been obtained, which requires B; B will be
       involved again, in the definition of that FAC coordinate system.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.9 Input quantities and plot operations.





       Usually, plot quantities are chosen from plot menus.  The input
       quantities for these plots are generally fixed, the user cannot
       specify which input quantities to use.




       However, some plots can be created "on the fly" by means of "plot
       operations".

       Here, the user chooses a plot, and chooses an operation to apply
       to that plot.

       The result is one or more new plots, for which the user has
       chosen the input quantities.




       Within this document, Science plots that can be created by means
       of plot operations will be described as appropriate.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.10 Convolution.





       Convolution is available as a "plot operation".




       Users interested in this subject can get more information from
       SSL.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    3.11 Vector orientation.





       Some plots provide the orientation of some vectors with respect
       to some particular coordinate system.




       What is provided is the following:



           1) Direction cosines.

              These are the cosines of the angles between the vector and
              the positive X, Y, and Z coordinate axes.

              The direction cosines are the same as the components of
              the normalized vector.



           2) Direction angles.

              These are the angles between the vector and the positive
              X, Y, and Z coordinate axes.



           3) Latitude and longitude.

              These are the latitude and longitude that correspond to
              the direction of the vector; with respect to the
              coordinate system.

    4. Details on the computation of Science quantities.





       This section has information on how the main Science quantities
are calculated.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.1 Magnetic field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.1.1 Instantaneous magnetic field.





       The instantaneous magnetic field comes from the measured values
       of the magnetic field.




       The instantaneous magnetic field is obtained as follows:




           1) Determination of spin period average offsets.



              There are 2 offsets: one for FGM_Y, one for FGM_Z.


              Each offset is a spin period running average; the number
              of spin periods used for the running average can be
              specified by the user.


              The running average is obtained by taking all the data
              points within the specified number of spin periods, and
              averaging their values to obtain one output data point;
              then, the points in the first spin period are discarded,
              a new spin period is added at the end, and a new average
              is computed for the next output data point; etc.


              It is clear that the running average has one data point
              for each spin period.


              The user can specify also the minimum number of input data
              points required per spin period, in order to determine an
              offset.



              The inputs used to obtain the offsets are the
              instantaneous "corrected FGM_Y 2", or the instantaneous
              "corrected FGM_Z 2".




              The "corrected FGM_Y 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected FGM_Y" described below; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.


              This is analogous for FGM_Z.




           2) Applying correction terms.



              Each spin plane component of the magnetic field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Constant offset.




           3) Applying correction terms.



              Each spin plane component of the magnetic field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Spin period average offset.




          This produces a "corrected FGM_Y" and a "corrected FGM_Z".




           4) Despinning of spin plane components.



              This removes the effect of having the spin plane
              components of B measured by an instrument that rotates
              with the spacecraft.




       Most important user parameters:

           Constant offset for each of FGM_Y, FGM_Z.

           Choice of subtracting spin period average offsets from the
           spin plane components.

           Minimum number of points per spin period.

           Number of spin periods for spin period average offsets.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.1.2 Spin period magnetic field.





       The spin period magnetic field comes from the measured values of
       the magnetic field.




       The spin period magnetic field is obtained as follows:




           1) The spin plane components come from a least-squares spin
              fit of the "corrected FGM_Y 2".




              The "corrected FGM_Y 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected FGM_Y" described above; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.




           2) The spin axis component comes from a least-squares spin
              fit of the FGM_X component of the instantaneous magnetic
              field.




       The minimum number of data points per spin period, specified by
       the user and used to obtain the spin period average offsets for
       the spin plane components; is also used as a minimum number of
       data points required for the spin fits.




       Most important user parameters:

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous magnetic field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2 Electric field.





       In what follows, reference is made to the components of the
       electric field that can be measured, V12 and V34.



       However, sphere 1 of the electric field instrument on spacecraft
       1 failed on 2001/12/28; sphere 1 of the electric field instrument
       on spacecraft 3 failed on 2002/07/29; and sphere 1 of the
       electric field instrument on spacecraft 2 failed on 2007/05/13.

       Following the failure of sphere 1, no measurement of V12 is
       possible on any of these spacecraft (spacecrafts 1, 2, and 3).



       The mode of operation of the electric field instrument can be
       changed, so that instead of V12 and V34 it will measure and
       transmit V34 and V32.

       This instrument mode was used briefly for tests starting in March
       of 2003, for spacecraft 1 and 3; and was put into effect on a
       regular basis starting on 2003/05/25.

       Similar tests were done for spacecraft 2 after the failure of its
       sphere 1; V32 became available on a regular basis on 2007/11/24.

       Spacecraft 4 continues to measure and transmit V12 and V34.

       It is intended that spacecraft 4 will continue to provide V12 and
       V34; and that spacecraft 1, 2, and 3 will provide V34 and V32.



       The program "sdt" has been modified to use the measured value of
       V12 when available; and to calculate a value for V12, deduced
       from the values of V34 and V32, when V34 and V32 are available
       instead (see Warning below).



       However, there is a long period of time during which neither V12
       nor V32 is available for spacecraft 1, 2, and 3 (see Warning
       below).

       Therefore, a ground-computed V32 ("ground V32") is calculated by
       "sdt", from the single-probe values V3 and V2; as well as a
       "combined V32", which is equal to the on-board V32 when
       available, and equal to the ground V32 before the on-board V32
       became available.  The combined V32 is then used together with
       V34 to calculate V12.

       Note that for Instantaneous data, V34 and the on-board V32
       typically have a time resolution of about 25 data points per
       second; but V3 and V2 typically have a time resolution of about 5
       data points per  second.  If the ground V32 is used to obtain
       V12, then the resulting electric field will be at this lower time
       resolution.



       IMPORTANT WARNING:

       Before nearly the end of May 2003, no values of on-board V32 are
       available for spacecraft 1 or spacecraft 3, except for the brief
       tests mentioned above.

       Furthermore, the quality of the values of V32 is likely to be
       inferior to that of V34; the V12 calculated from V34 and V32 is
       likely to be of inferior quality.

       Whenever spin period time resolution is adequate, the better
       option is to use spin period "34" quantities, which come from a
       least-squares spin fit of V34, and do not involve V12 at all.

       A similar situation occurs for spacecraft 2, starting in 2007, as
       indicated above.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.1 Instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.1.1 Instantaneous electric field, spin plane components.





       The spin plane components of the instantaneous electric field are
       obtained as follows:




           1) Determination of the combined V12.



              The "combined V12" is determined as follows:

               1) For spacecraft 4: this is the "regular" V12.

               2) For spacecraft 1, 2, and 3, before sphere 1 of each of
                  these spacecraft failed: this is the "regular" V12.

               3) For spacecraft 1, 2, and 3, after sphere 1 of each of
                  these spacecraft failed: this is the V12 calculated
                  from V34 and the combined V32.

                  The "ground V32" is calculated on the ground, from the
                  on-board V3 and V2.

                  Starting on 2003/05/25, the V32 for spacecraft 1 and 3
                  is among the on-board data.

                  Starting on 2007/11/24, the V32 for spacecraft 2 is
                  among the on-board data.

                  The "combined V32" is equal to the on-board V32 after
                  the on-board V32 became available for spacecraft 1, 2,
                  and 3; and equal to the ground V32 before then.


              Please refer to the information at the beginning of the
              section on Electric field; particularly, the Warning
              provided there.




           2) Selection by avoidance of B.



              Input data points for V12 are selected only if:

               1) The angle between the 12 boom and the B vector is
                  greater than or equal to a chosen minimum value; and

               2) The angle between the 12 boom and the -B vector is
                  greater than or equal to the minimum value.



              The user can specify the minimum value (minimum angle)
              used in this selection.



              The user can specify also a threshold value for the
              magnitude of the B vector, |B|.

              If |B| is less than the threshold, this selection step is
              not performed, and no data points are discarded on account
              of it.

              This is because if |B| is very small, the direction of the
              B vector may be considered to be poorly defined; and also
              because a very weak B will not affect the electric field
              measurements as much.



              An analogous selection is done for V34, based on the angle
              between the 34 boom and B (and the angle between the 34
              boom and -B).



              It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on
              the spin plane; but B and -B are full, 3-dimensional
              vectors, and their spin plane and their spin axis
              components are used in these calculations.




           3) Selection by latitude of B.



              Input data points for V12 are selected only if the
              absolute value of the latitude of the B vector with
              respect to the spin plane is greater than or equal to a
              chosen minimum value.



              The user can specify the minimum value (minimum latitude)
              used in this selection.



              The threshold value for |B|, used in the previous step, is
              used here as well.

              If |B| is less than the threshold, this selection step is
              not performed, and no data points are discarded on account
              of it.

              This is because if |B| is very small, the direction of the
              B vector may be considered to be poorly defined; and also
              because a very weak B will not affect the electric field
              measurements as much.



              An analogous selection is done for V34.




          The magnetic field used to select the data points is the
          instantaneous B.




           4) Selection by avoidance of the Sun vector.



              Input data points for V12 are selected only if:

               1) The angle between the 12 boom and the Sun vector S is
                  greater than or equal to a chosen minimum value; and

               2) The angle between the 12 boom and the -S vector is
                  greater than or equal to the minimum value.



              The user can specify the minimum value (minimum angle)
              used in this selection.



              An analogous selection is done for V34, based on the angle
              between the 34 boom and S (and the angle between the 34
              boom and -S).



              It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on
              the spin plane; but S and -S are full, 3-dimensional
              vectors, and their spin plane and their spin axis
              components are used in these calculations.




           5) The result of the selection steps above is a "selected
              V12" and a "selected V34".


              These are the data points that satisfy all the selection
              criteria.



              From now on, only the selected data points are used.




           6) Determination of spin period average offsets.



              There are 2 offsets: one for V12, one for V34.


              Each offset is a spin period running average; the number
              of spin periods used for the running average can be
              specified by the user.


              The running average is obtained by taking all the data
              points within the specified number of spin periods, and
              averaging their values to obtain one output data point;
              then, the points in the first spin period are discarded,
              a new spin period is added at the end, and a new average
              is computed for the next output data point; etc.


              It is clear that the running average has one data point
              for each spin period.


              The user can specify also the minimum number of input data
              points required per spin period, in order to determine an
              offset.



              The inputs used to obtain the offsets are the
              instantaneous "corrected V12 2", or the instantaneous
              "corrected V34 2".




              The "corrected V12 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected V12" described below; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.


              This is analogous for V34.



              First, an offset is determined for V12L as explained
              above; and an offset is obtained similarly for V12M.

              Offsets are obtained also for V34L and for V34M.



              Then, a combined offset for V12 is built by merging the
              data points for the offsets for V12L and for V12M.

              Similarly, a combined offset for V34 is built by merging
              the data points for the offsets for V34L and for V34M.



              Note that V12H and V34H are not included in the process of
              obtaining the combined offsets.  Since V12H and V34H
              correspond to high band-pass filtered data, it is
              appropriate to exclude them from this calculation.




           7) Applying correction terms.



              All of these corrections are applied at this point; some
              of them may be described more completely further below.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Constant offset.


               2) Sine wave correction.




           8) Sine wave correction.



              A sine wave correction is subtracted from each spin plane
              component of the electric field; to correspond to a
              specified Sunward field to be subtracted, and to a
              specified dawn-dusk field to be subtracted.




           9) Scale.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field has its
              value multiplied by a constant scale factor.



              One reason to apply a scale factor is that the wires in
              the electric field instrument are at the spacecraft's
              potential; this has the effect of partially diminishing
              the potential difference between the spheres.

              The proper scale factor to correct for this effect varies
              somewhat; an average correction is a scale factor of 1.2.



              When plotting electric field data for CLUSTER for times
              prior to the full deployment of the instrument spheres,
              users must be aware of the need to adjust the electric
              field values for the actual sphere separation.



              This is explained in the following Warning by Professor
              Forrest Mozer, that was issued quite some time ago, and is
              reproduced here.


              "The Cluster science quantities produced by the recently
              released version of SDT assume that the sphere separation
              is 88 meters.
              This is correct when the spheres are fully deployed.
              However, for any boom length less than the fully deployed
              length, you have to multiply V12 or V34 by a factor for
              the plots to correctly display the electric field.  These
              factors may be found by clicking on "parameter" in the
              main menu and changing the values of "Scale factor for
              V12" or "Scale factor for V34" for the appropriate
              spacecraft.  For example, if spheres 1 and 2 are each
              deployed 20 meters, their sphere-to-sphere separation is
              46 meters, so the scale factor is 88/46".



              In summary:


               1) The user must find out what the actual
                  sphere-to-sphere separation is for the time of
                  interest.


               2) In the example given above, where the sphere-to-sphere
                  separation is 46 meters for spheres 1 and 2, the scale
                  factor is 88/46, or 1.91.


               3) This factor of 1.91 is on top of the scale factor
                  explained above, to correct for the effect of the
                  wires.

                  If we assume that the scale factor for the effect of
                  the wires is 1.2, then the final factor will be
                  (1.2 * 1.91), or 2.3.


               4) In the parameter menu, you must set the scale factor
                  appropriately.

                  In the example given above, the scale factor for V12
                  in the parameter menu must be set to 2.3.


               5) An analogous procedure must be followed to determine
                  and set the scale factor for V34.



              The boom deployments took place over several weeks after
              the launches, and were completed by the end of October,
              2000.  Therefore, the analysis of any data for 2000/11/01
              or later will not require a correction for the sphere
              separation.

              On the other hand, the correction for the effect of the
              wires may be needed at any time.




          10) Applying correction terms.



              Each spin plane component of the electric field can have
              the following correction terms subtracted:


               1) Spin period average offset.

                  The spin period average offset that is used is the
                  combined spin period averaged offset.

                  The correction for spin period average offset is not
                  applied to high band-pass filtered data (V12H, V34H).




          This produces a "corrected V12" and a "corrected V34".




          11) Despinning of spin plane components.



              This removes the effect of having the spin plane
              components of E measured by an instrument that rotates
              with the spacecraft.




          12) Filtering.



              A convolution can be performed on each despun spin plane
              component of the electric field; to remove shadow effects.

    4.2.1.2 Instantaneous electric field, spin axis component.





       The spin axis component of the instantaneous electric field is
       obtained as follows:




           1) 5 versions of the electric field.



              Because a measurement of the spin axis component of the
              electric field is not available, 5 versions of the
              electric field are defined, depending on what is used for
              the value of the spin axis component.



              The spin plane components for all 5 versions of the
              electric field are the same.



               1) E_0.


                  For E_0, the spin axis component of the electric field
                  is assumed to be zero.



               2) E_Dot0.


                  For E_Dot0, the spin axis component of the electric
                  field is assumed to have a value such, that the dot
                  product of E_Dot0 and B is zero.


                  If the spin plane axes are X and Y, then the spin axis
                  component for E_Dot0 will be determined by:

                      EZ = - (EX * BX + EY * BY) / BZ


                  This expression will not be well defined if |BZ| is
                  too small; or if either |BX/BZ| or |BY/BZ| is too
                  large.

                  The user can specify a lower limit for |BZ|, and an
                  upper limit for |BX/BZ| and |BY/BZ|; if either of
                  these limits is exceeded, E_Dot0 is undefined.



               3) E_X0.


                  For E_X0, the spin axis component of the electric
                  field is assumed to have a value such, that the X
                  component of E_X0 in Field-Aligned Coordinates is
                  zero.


                  If the spin plane axes are X and Y, and if A is a
                  rotation matrix that transforms vector components from
                  the spin plane/spin axis system to the Field-Aligned
                  system (with aij denoting the element of A in row i
                  and column j); then the spin axis component for E_X0
                  will be determined by:

                      a11 * EX + a12 * EY + a13 * EZ = 0

                  i.e.,

                      EZ = - (a11 * EX + a12 * EY) / a13


                  This expression will not be well defined if |a13| is
                  too small.

                  The user can specify a lower limit for the absolute
                  value of the coefficient of EZ for E_X0; if this limit
                  is exceeded, E_X0 is undefined.



               4) E_Y0.


                  For E_Y0, the spin axis component of the electric
                  field is assumed to have a value such, that the Y
                  component of E_Y0 in Field-Aligned Coordinates is
                  zero.


                  All the above relating to E_X0 can be applied to E_Y0
                  as well.  For E_Y0 we must use the second row of the
                  matrix A (elements a21, a22, a23).



               5) E_Z0.


                  For E_Z0, the spin axis component of the electric
                  field is assumed to have a value such, that the Z
                  component of E_Z0 in Field-Aligned Coordinates is
                  zero.


                  All the above relating to E_X0 can be applied to E_Z0
                  as well.  For E_Z0 we must use the third row of the
                  matrix A (elements a31, a32, a33).


                  It should be noted that E_Z0 is conceptually the same
                  as E_Dot0, as each of them is perpendicular to B.

                  In practice, there may be differences in the values of
                  E_Dot0 and E_Z0, due to different procedures for
                  calculating each of the quantities; but any
                  differences should be very small.




       The magnetic field used to determine E_Dot0 is the instantaneous
       B.


       The magnetic field used to define the Field-Aligned Coordinate
       system used in the determination of E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0; is the
       instantaneous B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Threshold for |B|.

           Minimum angle E spin plane boom and B vector.

           Minimum |coefficient of EZ| for E_Z0.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.2 Burst electric field.





       The burst electric field is obtained in the same manner as the
       instantaneous electric field; with the obvious difference that
       burst data is used instead of instantaneous data.




       There are, then, 5 versions of the burst electric field as well:
       E_0, E_Dot0, E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0.



       The spin plane components for all 5 versions of the electric
       field are the same.




       The magnetic field used to select the data points, to determine
       E_Dot0, and to determine E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0; is the instantaneous
       B.




       It must be noted that the instantaneous data values of V12 and
       V34 are still used for the burst electric field, in the
       determination of the spin average offsets for the spin plane
       component.




       Most important user parameters:

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.3 Spin period electric field.





       The spin period electric field is obtained as follows:




           1) The spin plane components come from a least-squares spin
              fit of: either the instantaneous "corrected V12 2", or the
              instantaneous "corrected V34 2".




              The "corrected V12 2" is the same as the instantaneous
              "corrected V12" described above; except that it does not
              have a spin period average offset subtracted.


              This is analogous for V34.




           2) 5 versions of the electric field.



              For the spin period electric field we have also 5
              versions, the same as for the instantaneous and burst time
              resolutions.



              The spin plane components for all 5 versions of the
              electric field are the same.



              In the calculation of E_Dot0, E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0; the same
              limits specified by the user are applied, as for the
              instantaneous and burst cases.




       The minimum number of data points per spin period, specified by
       the user and used to obtain the spin period average offsets for
       the spin plane components; is also used as a minimum number of
       data points required for the spin fits.




       The magnetic field used to determine E_Dot0, E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0; is
       the spin period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.2.4 Housekeeping spin fit electric field.





       The housekeeping spin fit electric field is obtained as follows:




           1) The spin plane components come from a least-squares spin
              fit of either V12U or V34U.




           2) 5 versions of the electric field.



              For the housekeeping spin fit electric field we have also
              5 versions, the same as for the other time resolutions.



              The spin plane components for all 5 versions of the
              electric field are the same.



              In the calculation of E_0, corrections can be applied in
              the form of a Sunward field and a dawn-dusk field to be
              subtracted.



              In the calculation of E_Dot0, E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0; the same
              limits specified by the user are applied, as for the other
              time resolutions.




       The magnetic field used to determine E_Dot0, E_X0, E_Y0, E_Z0; is
       the spin period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Sunward field for correction to E_0.

           Dawn-dusk field for correction to E_0.

           Applicable parameters from the instantaneous electric field.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.3 Transformed electric field.





       The electric field obtained so far is in the frame of reference
       of the spacecraft.



       We can obtain the electric field in the frame of reference of the
       center of the Earth.



       For 2 versions of the electric field, namely, E_0 and E_Dot0; 2
       corresponding versions of the transformed electric field are
       defined, depending on the version of the electric field that is
       used in the calculation.

       The 2 versions of the transformed electric field are designated
       E_0_T and E_Dot0_T.



       Each of these versions of the transformed E is obtained by adding
       to the corresponding E_0, or E_Dot0, the appropriate correction
       determined by

           V x B

       where V is the velocity of the spacecraft.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       spin period, and housekeeping spin fit transformed electric
       field; are the instantaneous, burst, spin period, and
       housekeeping spin fit data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used for the correction, for instantaneous and
       for burst data, is the instantaneous B; for spin period data, and
       for housekeeping spin fit data, it is the spin period B.




       It should be noted that, although the spin axis component of E_0
       is zero (by definition); the spin axis component of E_0_T in
       general will not be zero.



       On the other hand, since E_Dot0 is perpendicular to B (by
       definition), and (V x B) is also perpendicular to B; E_Dot0_T
       will also be perpendicular to B.




       There are plot menus containing plots of the transformed electric
       field.

       In addition, it is possible to create "on the fly" plots of an E
       that is transformed by a constant velocity; the value of the
       constant velocity is specified by the user.

       The resulting quantity is calculated as: E + V x B.


       The procedure for creating an "on the fly" plot is as follows:

        1) At least 1 component of the E to be used must be plotted.
           At least 1 component of the B to be used must be plotted.

        2) Click the right mouse button on the plot of a component of E.
           In the menu that appears, select "Operations".
           In the menu that appears, select "E + Vconst x B".

        3) If the plot chosen has more than 1 line plot ("trace") in it,
           a box appears where 1 trace is to be chosen (click left mouse
           button), for a component of E.

        4) A box appears where:
            1) The values of the components of the velocity are to be
               entered.
            2) 1 quantity is to be chosen (click left mouse button), for
               B.

        5) Click the left mouse button on the "Compute" button.

        6) After the plots are created, the values entered for the
           components of the velocity can be changed via the
           "Parameter" button.


       It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that:

        1) The plot or trace selected for a component of E does, indeed,
           correspond to a component of an electric field.  E must be in
           units of mV/m.

        2) The quantity selected for B does, indeed, correspond to a
           magnetic field.  B must be in units of nT.

        3) The values entered for the components of the velocity V must
           be in units of km/sec.

        4) The components of E, B, and V all refer to the same
           orientation of coordinate system axes.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.4 Spacecraft potential.





       The spacecraft potential S_C_Pot12 is defined as follows:


           S_C_Pot12 = (V1 + V2) / 2



       The spacecraft potential S_C_Pot34 is defined analogously.




       Different spacecraft potentials can be obtained depending on
       whether the voltages that are used are all "L", or all "M", etc.




       For instantaneous and for burst time resolutions, the spacecraft
       potentials come from individual data points for the voltages V1,
       V2, etc.; at instantaneous or burst time resolution,
       respectively.


       For spin period time resolution, the spacecraft potentials come
       from spin period averages of the instantaneous voltages V1, V2,
       etc.




       For instantaneous, burst, and spin period time resolutions, one
       additional spacecraft potential, S_C_Pot1234, is defined as
       follows:


           S_C_Pot1234 = (S_C_Pot12 + S_C_Pot34) / 2




       For burst time resolution, one additional quantity,
       S_C_Pot_Delta, is defined as follows:


           S_C_Pot_Delta = 2 * (S_C_Pot12 - S_C_Pot34)




       It should be noted that the voltages V1, V2, etc., at
       instantaneous or burst time resolution; or the spin period
       averages of the instantaneous voltages V1, V2,, etc.; are
       spacecraft potential values themselves.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.5 ExB plasma velocity.





       The ExB plasma velocity is determined as follows:


           v = (E x B) / (|B|^2)


       where ^ indicates exponentiation.




       The same threshold value for |B| that is used in the selection of
       data points for the instantaneous and burst electric fields, is
       used also in the computation of the ExB plasma velocity: the
       value of v is considered to be undefined if |B| is less than the
       threshold.




       For 2 versions of the electric field, namely, E_0 and E_Dot0; 2
       corresponding versions of the ExB plasma velocity are defined,
       depending on the version of the electric field that is used in
       the calculation.

       The 2 versions of the ExB plasma velocity are designated v_0 and
       v_Dot0.



       Furthermore, there are 2 versions of the transformed electric
       field, namely, E_0_T, and E_Dot0_T; and from these we can obtain
       2 other versions of the ExB plasma velocity, designated as v_0_T
       and v_Dot0_T.



       In summary, all 4 versions of the ExB plasma velocity are
       obtained using the same expression above, that involves E and B;
       the difference among them being which version of the electric
       field is used for E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       spin period, and housekeeping spin fit ExB plasma velocity; are
       the instantaneous, burst, spin period, and housekeeping spin fit
       data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used to obtain the ExB plasma velocity is the
       instantaneous B, for instantaneous and for burst data; for spin
       period data, and for housekeeping spin fit data, it is the spin
       period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Threshold for |B|.




       There are plot menus containing plots of the ExB plasma velocity.

       In addition, it is possible to create "on the fly" plots of this
       quantity.


       The procedure for creating an "on the fly" plot is as follows:

        1) At least 1 component of the E to be used must be plotted.
           At least 1 component of the B to be used must be plotted.

        2) Click the right mouse button on the plot of a component of E.
           In the menu that appears, select "Operations".
           In the menu that appears, select "ExB Vel".

        3) If the plot chosen has more than 1 line plot ("trace") in it,
           a box appears where 1 trace is to be chosen (click left mouse
           button), for a component of E.

        4) A box appears where 1 quantity is to be chosen (click left
           mouse button), for B.

        5) Click the left mouse button on the "Compute" button.


       It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that:

        1) The plot or trace selected for a component of E does, indeed,
           correspond to a component of an electric field.  E must be in
           units of mV/m.

        2) The quantity selected for B does, indeed, correspond to a
           magnetic field.  B must be in units of nT.

        3) The components of E and B both refer to the same orientation
           of coordinate system axes.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.6 Plasma potential.





       The plasma potential is defined as follows:


           Plasma_Pot = - Integral of (E dot ds)


       where ds is the element of distance along the path of the
       spacecraft.




       In practice, instead of using ds in the computation, what is used
       is

           ds = V * dt

       where V is the spacecraft velocity, and dt is the element of
       time.




       E and ds are expressed in Field-Aligned Coordinates (FAC); and
       only the contributions to the dot product from the X and the Y
       components are used.  The contribution from the Z component (the
       component of E parallel to B) is excluded from the result.


       For instantaneous and for burst time resolution, the FAC
       coordinate system that is used to obtain the plasma potential is
       FAC_I.


       For spin period and for housekeeping spin fit time resolution,
       the FAC coordinate system that is used to obtain the plasma
       potential is FAC_S.




       At the beginning of the time interval to be plotted, the value of
       the plasma potential is set to zero.


       Whenever there is a data dropout in E, the value of the integral
       remains "frozen" until more data points are available.


       In fact, data gaps in E can occur commonly, as data points are
       selected so as to exclude data when an electric field instrument
       boom is near the vector B (or -B).




       For 2 versions of the electric field, namely, E_0 and E_Dot0; 2
       corresponding versions of the plasma potential are defined,
       depending on the version of the electric field that is used in
       the calculation.

       The 2 versions of the plasma potential are designated
       Plasma_Pot_0 and Plasma_Pot_Dot0.



       The 2 versions of the plasma potential are obtained using the
       same expression above, that involves E and ds; the difference
       among them being which version of the electric field is used for
       E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       spin period, and housekeeping spin fit plasma potential; are the
       instantaneous, burst, spin period, and housekeeping spin fit
       data, respectively.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





    4.7 Plasma density.





       The plasma density n is obtained as a function of the spacecraft
       potential.




       The function is a sum of exponential functions, provided by Dr.
       Jim McFadden (University of California, Berkeley, Space Sciences
       Laboratory).

       It comes from a fit to the CLUSTER electron density data.




       n will be in units of cm^(-3), i.e., number of charges per cubic
       centimeter.




       By using the spacecraft potentials V1, V2, V3, V4, 12, 34, 1234;
       we obtain the plasma density n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_12, n_34,
       n_1234, respectively.




       The spacecraft potential data used to obtain the instantaneous,
       burst, and spin period plasma density; are the instantaneous,
       burst, and spin period data, respectively.




       The user can specify an offset to be subtracted from the
       spacecraft potential; the result is used as the argument to the
       function to produce the plasma density.




       If the value of the argument to the function is too large, then
       the plasma density is set to a "missing value" of 1.0e+20.

       Also, if the value of the function is too large, then the result
       is not reliable, and therefore the plasma density is set to a
       "missing value" of 1.0e+20.

       If the value of the argument to the function is too small, then
       the plasma density is set to a "missing value" of 1.0e-20.

    4.8 Poynting flux.





       The Poynting flux is determined as follows:


           Poyn_Flux = (Det E) x (Det B)


       where "Det" designates "detrended".




       The detrended vector E is the vector E minus a running average of
       the vector E; the detrended vector B is defined analogously.


       The running average is obtained by taking a time interval
       centered on each original data point, with a total duration equal
       to some number of spin periods; the original values for all the
       data points in the interval are averaged, and this becomes the
       new value for the data point.


       It is clear that the running average has one data point for each
       original data point.


       A running average can be obtained for instantaneous, spin period,
       or housekeeping spin fit electric field data.

       A running average can be obtained for instantaneous or spin
       period magnetic field data.

       For instantaneous data, we average the instantaneous data point
       values; for spin period data, we average the spin period data
       point values; for housekeeping spin fit data, we average the
       housekeeping spin fit data point values.


       Note that when averaging spin period data or housekeeping spin
       fit data, it is better to choose an odd number of spin periods;
       as this will assure that the exact number of data points (except
       for data gaps) is included in each average.  With an even number
       of spin periods, there will be uncertainty concerning the end
       points.


       For instantaneous, spin period, or housekeeping spin fit data,
       the detrended vector is the original vector minus the
       corresponding running average.


       For burst data, the detrended E is the original E, minus the
       running average determined by the instantaneous E.




       For 2 versions of the electric field, namely, E_0 and E_Dot0; 2
       corresponding versions of the Poynting flux are defined,
       depending on the version of the electric field that is used in
       the calculation.

       The 2 versions of the Poynting flux are designated Poyn_Flux_0
       and Poyn_Flux_Dot0.



       Furthermore, there are 2 versions of the transformed electric
       field, namely, E_0_T, and E_Dot0_T; and from these we can obtain
       2 other versions of the Poynting flux, designated as
       Poyn_Flux_0_T and Poyn_Flux_Dot0_T.



       In summary, all 4 versions of the Poynting flux are obtained
       using the same expression above, that involves E and B; the
       difference among them being which version of the electric field
       is used for E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       spin period, and housekeeping spin fit Poynting flux; are the
       instantaneous, burst, spin period, and housekeeping spin fit
       data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used to obtain the Poynting flux is the
       instantaneous B, for instantaneous and for burst data; for spin
       period data, and for housekeeping spin fit data, it is the spin
       period B.




       It should be noted that, since the spin axis component of E_0 is
       zero (by definition); the spin axis component of the running
       average of E_0, and of the detrended E_0; will also be zero.



       On the other hand, even though E_Dot0 is perpendicular to B (by
       definition), and E_Dot0_T also is perpendicular to B; in general,
       the running average and the detrended E_Dot0 and E_Dot0_T, will
       not be perpendicular to B, or to the running average of B, or to
       the detrended B.




       Most important user parameters:

    4.9 B flux.





       The B flux is defined as follows:


           B_flux = (E x B) / |B|




       The same threshold value for |B| that is used in the selection of
       data points for the instantaneous and burst electric fields, is
       used also in the computation of the B flux: the value of B_flux
       is considered to be undefined if |B| is less than the threshold.




       For 2 versions of the electric field, namely, E_0 and E_Dot0; 2
       corresponding versions of the B flux are defined, depending on
       the version of the electric field that is used in the
       calculation.

       The 2 versions of the B flux are designated B_Flux_0 and
       B_Flux_Dot0.



       In summary, all 2 versions of the B flux are obtained using the
       same expression above, that involves E and B; the difference
       among them being which version of the electric field is used for
       E.




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, spin
       period, and housekeeping spin fit B flux; are the instantaneous,
       spin period, and housekeeping spin fit data, respectively.




       The magnetic field used to obtain the B flux is the instantaneous
       B, for instantaneous data; for spin period data, and for
       housekeeping spin fit data, it is the spin period B.




       Most important user parameters:

           Threshold for |B|.




       There are plot menus containing plots of B flux.

       In addition, it is possible to create "on the fly" plots of this
       quantity.


       The procedure for creating an "on the fly" plot is as follows:

        1) At least 1 component of the E to be used must be plotted.
           At least 1 component of the B to be used must be plotted.

        2) Click the right mouse button on the plot of a component of E.
           In the menu that appears, select "Operations".
           In the menu that appears, select "B Flux".

        3) If the plot chosen has more than 1 line plot ("trace") in it,
           a box appears where 1 trace is to be chosen (click left mouse
           button), for a component of E.

        4) A box appears where 1 quantity is to be chosen (click left
           mouse button), for B.

        5) Click the left mouse button on the "Compute" button.


       It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that:

        1) The plot or trace selected for a component of E does, indeed,
           correspond to a component of an electric field.

        2) The quantity selected for B does, indeed, correspond to a
           magnetic field.

        3) The components of E and B both refer to the same orientation
           of coordinate system axes.

    4.10 Angles between the electric field spin plane instrument
         booms and the magnetic field.





       There are 2 angles that can be determined:


            1) The angle between the 12 boom and the B vector.


            2) The angle between the 34 boom and the B vector.




       The 12 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 1.


       The 34 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 3.




       It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on the
       spin plane; but B is a full, 3-dimensional vector, and its spin
       plane and its spin axis components are used in these
       calculations.




       The magnetic field used to determine the angles is the
       instantaneous B.




       The same threshold value for |B| that is used in the selection of
       data points for the instantaneous and burst electric fields, is
       used also in the computation of the angles between the electric
       field spin plane instrument booms and the magnetic field: the
       values of the angles are considered to be undefined if |B| is
       less than the threshold.

       This is because if |B| is very small, the direction of the
       B vector may be considered to be poorly defined.




       The determination of the angles can be done at any desired time
       resolution.




       Most important user parameters:

    4.11 Angles between the electric field spin plane instrument
         booms and the Sun vector.





       There are 2 angles that can be determined:


            1) The angle between the 12 boom and the Sun vector.


            2) The angle between the 34 boom and the Sun vector.




       The 12 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 1.


       The 34 boom is represented by a vector that points from the
       center of the spacecraft to sphere 3.




       The Sun vector S is the vector that points from the center of the
       Earth to the Sun.




       It should be noted that the 12 and 34 booms are always on the
       spin plane; but S is a full, 3-dimensional vector, and its spin
       plane and its spin axis components are used in these
       calculations.




       The determination of the angles can be done at any desired time
       resolution.




       Most important user parameters:

    4.12 Electric field FAC component ratios.





       These are the ratios


           EZ / EX

           EZ / EY


       where E is in Field-Aligned Coordinates; i.e., the ratios of

           E_parallel / E_perpendicular.




       The ratios are not well defined if the denominators are too
       small.


       The user can specify a lower limit for the absolute value of the
       denominator.




       If a denominator has an absolute value that is less than the
       lower limit, it is possible either to consider the corresponding
       ratio to be undefined (i.e., no data point is produced); or the
       ratio can be set to a very large value (which can be positive or
       negative).


       The user can specify whether to skip the data point for a small
       denominator, or to set a huge value.




       Only 1 version of the component ratios is defined, using E_0 in
       the calculation.


       No component ratios are plotted for E_Dot0 (for E_Dot0, the FAC Z
       component is zero by definition).




       The electric field data used to obtain the instantaneous, burst,
       spin period, and housekeeping spin fit FAC component ratios; are
       the instantaneous, burst, spin period, and housekeeping spin fit
       data, respectively.




       Most important user parameters:
