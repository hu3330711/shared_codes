   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces a running average for a single
       vector quantity.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) The input for the vector to be averaged.





    3) The user can set a basic "unit" time interval; the input quantity
       is averaged over a number "N" of basic time intervals chosen by
       the user.



       The basic time interval may be equal to the spin period of the
       spacecraft; but this is not required.





    4) For each input data point, an average is calculated.



       For any given input data point, the averaging time interval has a
       duration of N times the basic time interval; and is centered at
       the time of the specified input data point.





    5) The user can specify a minimum number of vector data values; this
       can be either the minimum number per basic time interval, or the
       minimum number per averaging interval.



       If the minimum specified is per basic time interval, then the
       minimum number per averaging interval is equal to N times the
       minimum number per basic time interval.



       If an averaging interval has fewer than the minimum number of
       input data values (per averaging time interval) in it; no output
       data point is written.





    6) When an averaging interval does contain a sufficient number of
       input data values, the output value is determined.



       The output value is computed as the average of all the input data
       values within the averaging interval.



       Note that this is an average of individual data point values (not
       an average of basic time interval averages).





    7) The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the input data point that is the center of the averaging
       interval.





    8) For an output data point to be produced, the entire averaging
       interval must fit within the total time interval being processed.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Duration of the basic time interval.


               Double.


               Units are seconds.


               Must be  >  0.



            3) Number of basic time intervals in an averaging interval.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            4) Minimum number of input data values.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.



            5) Flag to multiply the minimum number of input data values
               by the number of basic time intervals in an averaging
               interval.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    WT_TRUE   =  Multiply the minimum by N.

                    WT_FALSE  =  Do not multiply the minimum by N.



            6) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the 3 input vector components of the input to be
               averaged.



                1) Input component index.


                   Int.





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



            1) The input to be averaged.


               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:

       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.

            2) Component 1 of the output vector.
