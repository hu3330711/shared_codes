   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module uses spin fits to obtain a vector in DSC, at
       spin period time resolution.



       Only components on the spin plane are processed; the spin axis
       component is set to zero.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) Spin fit of a component of the vector on the spin plane.


               The spin fit coefficients B and C are used.





    3) There is a reference line on the spin plane, that rotates with
       the spacecraft; every azimuth is an angle on the spin plane,
       measured from this reference line.



       Each azimuth is made up of the sum of a main part plus an
       additional part; the sum, then, is azimuth with respect to the
       reference line.



       The user can specify: the azimuth of the boom that measures the
       spin plane component whose spin fit is used; and the azimuth of
       the Sun pulse.





    4) There is a phase offset, that was used when the spin fit of the
       spin plane component was produced.



       The user can specify a main part of the phase offset, and an
       additional part of the phase offset.



       The actual phase offset is the sum of these two parts.





    5) Provision is made for the possibility that each spin fit
       coefficient may have its input value "reversed" (i.e., its sign
       has been reversed).





    6) The user can specify corrections to the spin plane DSC components
       of the resulting vector.  The correction for each component is a
       constant offset.



       For each component, the user can specify an additional scale
       correction factor.



       For each component, the user can specify an additional direction
       correction factor.

       This factor must be either +1 or -1.



       The value of a component correction is related to the value of
       the corresponding offset as follows:


           Correction value = (Scale correction factor) *
                              (Direction correction factor) *
                              (Offset)



       These corrections are subtracted from the DSC components.





    7) The user can specify a scale factor for the component whose spin
       fit is used.



       The user can specify a direction factor for the component whose
       spin fit is used, to allow for the possibility that the measured
       value is in the opposite direction of the vector component.

       This factor must be either +1 (same direction) or -1 (opposite
       direction).



       The value of the vector component is related to the value of the
       measured component in the same direction as follows:


           Vector component = (Scale factor) *
                              (Direction factor) *
                              (Measured component)



       The scale factor is applied after the corrections to the DSC
       components have been applied.





    8) For an input data point of the spin fit of the spin plane
       component to be used, its time tag must not be closer to that of
       neighboring data points than a minimum time separation specified
       by the user.





    9) An output data point is produced for each input point of the spin
       fit of the spin plane component.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input data point of the spin fit of the spin
       plane component.
