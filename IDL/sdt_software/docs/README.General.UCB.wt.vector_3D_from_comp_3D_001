   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces a 3D vector from 3 separate
       components.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) Vector component 1.



            2) Vector component 2.



            3) Vector component 3.





    3) An output data point is produced for each successful match
       containing a data point of each of the following inputs:

            1) Vector component 1.

            2) Vector component 2.

            3) Vector component 3.



       The time tag for the output data point is a weighted average of
       the time tags of the input data points participating in the
       match.



       The weights for the average for the output time tag are specified
       by the user.

       All the weights must be zero or positive.





    4) The user can specify a separate maximum time separation for each
       input to be matched; larger time separations between consecutive
       input data points are considered to be data dropouts.





    5) The user can specify a tolerance factor for the time matching.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0      =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1   =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                              dump frequency); i.e., every n-th point.

                    <= -1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-1)  (where -n is the
                              chosen dump frequency); i.e., the first n
                              points.



            2) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each input vector component.



                1) Weight for output time tag.


                   Double.


                   Must be  >=  0.



                2) Maximum time separation for consecutive input data
                   points.


                   Double.


                   Units are seconds.


                   Must be  >  0.



                3) Input component index.


                   Int.



               The sum of the weights for the output time tag must be
               >  0  (not necessarily 1).



            3) Tolerance factor for time match.


               Double.
