   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module extracts a row or a column from a matrix in
       3D.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) The matrix from which to extract the vector.





    3) An output data point is produced for each input matrix.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input matrix.





------------------------------------------------------------------------





   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0     =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                             0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                             dump frequency).



            2) Code for extracting row or column.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    1  =  Extract row.

                    2  =  Extract column.



            3) Number of the row or column to be extracted.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1  and  <=  3.


               The first row (or column) is designated by 1.



            4) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the 9 input matrix components.



                1) Input component index.


                   Int.


                   The indices must correspond to the matrix elements in
                   row-major order (column subscript varies fastest).





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



            1) The matrix from which to extract the vector.


               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.

                   Double.

                   Must be component 0.


                2) Additional components for the 9 matrix components.

                   Double.





    6) The output data quantity is a time series (Standard data type)
       and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) Component 1 of the output vector.


               Float.



            3) Component 2 of the output vector.


               Float.



            4) Component 3 of the output vector.


               Float.
