Usage of "NRT_Client":
---------------------

"NRT_Client" is a program which is used to read ISTP Near-Real-Time
data, from the network as available from the ISTP CDHF, and write the
data, in standard ISTP LZ format (no FLR however), into a local disk
file.


Program Use:
-----------

The program is invoked as follows:

    NRT_Client -u username -p passwd -t datatype -f outputfile <-r numrecs>
    <-v> <-s server>

Note that the arguments:

    -u username, -p passwd, -t datatype, -f outputfile

are required and arguments:

    -r numrecs, -v, -s server

are optional.

Also note that all of the option letters (u,p,t,f,r,v,s) can be lower or
upper case.

If no arguments are used, the program will immediately exit, after
outputting a brief usage instruction message to standard out (stdout).


Description of Arguments:
------------------------

    -u  Sets the username with which to login to the CDFH

    -p  Sets the password with which to login to the CDFH

    -t  Sets the data type to receive - it must be one of the following
	strings:

	  PO_LZ_CAM
	  PO_LZ_CEP
	  PO_LZ_EFI
	  PO_LZ_HYD
	  PO_LZ_MFE
	  PO_LZ_PIX
	  PO_LZ_PWI
	  PO_LZ_SCR
	  PO_LZ_TID
	  PO_LZ_TIM
	  PO_LZ_UVI
	  PO_LZ_VIS
	  WI_LZ_3DP
	  WI_LZ_EPA
	  WI_LZ_KON
	  WI_LZ_MFI
	  WI_LZ_SCR
	  WI_LZ_SMS
	  WI_LZ_SWE
	  WI_LZ_TGR
	  WI_LZ_WAV

	Note that only one data type can be requested per program
	invocation.

    -f  Sets the name of the output file to receive the data.

    -r  Indicates how many records to read.  If not set or set to zero,
	all records are written to "outputfile".

    -v  Sets the verbose flag - a summary of each frame is sent to stdout.

    -s  Resets the NRT server from the default:  istp6.gsfc.nasa.gov


Program Action:
--------------

Once invoked, the program will perform the following:

   1.  Connect, via a socket, to the NRT server program running on
       the CDHF machine.  The default CDHF machine is:

	   istp6.gsfc.nasa.gov

       If, for any reason, you need to connect with a different NRT
       serving machine, you can do so with the "-s" argument.

   2.  Login to the CDHF machine, using the CDHF username/password
       as specified with the "-u" and "-p" arguments.

   3.  Select the data type (specified by the "-t" argument) for
       reception.

   4.  Begin reception of the requested packets.  If the "-r" argument
       has been used with a positive integer, then only that many frames
       will be accumulated.  Otherwise, all frames will be accumulated
       until either:

	    an end of pass packet is received

       or

	    the user kills the program with ctrl-C

       Note that the frames are written into the file set by the "-f"
       argument and are stored in the standard Level Zero ISTP file
       format for the selected type of data, except that no FLR is
       written.  The 24-byte packet headers and 8-byte packet trailers
       are not written into the output file.

       The program writes the frames silently, unless the "-v" option
       has been invoked.  In this case, a brief summary of each frame
       is written, upon its reception, to standard out (stdout).
