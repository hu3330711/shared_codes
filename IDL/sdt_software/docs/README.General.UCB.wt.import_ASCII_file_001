   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module creates an SDT quantity from an ASCII input
       file.





    2) There are no SDT inputs.





    3) The user has the option of not having an input file at all.



       If there is no input file, then the SDT output has zero data
       data points.





    4) All the times in the file must be referred to the same date.



       Therefore, times could go over 86,400 seconds (and could be
       negative).





    5) The user can designate a limit for the length of an input line.



       This limit refers to the largest number of characters allowed for
       a line (not counting the "newline" or end of line character).





    6) The user can designate a special "comment character", that makes
       lines from the input file be treated as comment lines.



       A line is considered a comment line if its first (or only)
       non-white space character is the "comment character".


       Other types of comment lines are described below.





    7) An output data point is produced for each data point in the
       input file; provided that it is within the time interval
       specified to SDT.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as the time
       tag for the corresponding input data point.



       The data quantity values for the output data point are the same
       as the values for the corresponding input data point.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                   0     =  Do not dump.

                   >= 1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                            0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                            dump frequency).



            2) Flag for the input file.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                   WT_TRUE   =  There is an input file.

                   WT_FALSE  =  There is no input file.



            3) Directory for the input file.


               Char.


               If there is an input file, then
               must be a valid directory (not blank).



            4) File name for the input file.


               Char.


               This is the file name only (no path).


               If there is an input file, then
               must be a valid file name (not blank), and
               the file must exist.



            5) Maximum number of characters for an input line.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  0.



            6) Comment character.


               Char.


               Must be a single, non-white-space character.



            7) Date to which the time in the file is referred.


               Char.


               Must be a valid date in the format YYYY/MM/DD (e.g.,
               1996/05/29).



            8) Number of data quantities for each data point.


               Int.


               Must be  >=  1.





    4) The following input data files are used:



            1) The file with the input data.


               This file is an ASCII file.


               The following are considered to be comment lines:

                1) Empty lines.

                2) Lines with only white space (spaces and/or tabs).

                3) Lines whose first (or only) non-white space character
                   is the designated "comment character".


               Each line not a comment line contains one data point.


               Fields within each line must be separated by white space,
               and are not restricted to fixed character positions.


               The fields must be as follows:


                1) Time.

                   Real.

                   This is time in seconds, since 0 hours of the
                   designated date.


                2) One or more additional fields, one for the value of
                   each data quantity for the data point.

                   Real.


               The lines should be in sequence of increasing time.

               This is not checked, but if not true may lead to
               incorrect results.


               No line should be longer than the designated limit.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



           None.





    6) The SDT output data quantity is a time series (Standard data
       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) One component for each input data quantity value.


               Float.
