   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces a quality flag for the number of
       data points of any number of data inputs, within a time interval,
       that have out of range data values.



       There is a timing input, that is used to set the time tags for
       the quality flag, and the time intervals.



       There can be any number of input data quantities; each one has a
       separate range of valid data values.



       A range of valid data values can be specified with either a
       minimum value and a maximum value, or with a maximum absolute
       value.

       If the range is specified with a maximum absolute value, then the
       lower limit will be minus the maximum absolute value.





    2) There must be the following inputs:



            1) The timing input, that is used to set the time tags for
               the quality flag, and the time intervals.



            2) 1 or more data quantity inputs, with the data quantities
               whose values are to be inspected.





    3) For an input data point of the timing input to be used, its input
       time tag must not be closer to that of neighboring data points
       than a minimum time separation specified by the user; and it must
       not be farther from that of neighboring data points than a
       maximum time separation specified by the user.





    4) For each data quantity input, there must be 1 or more data
       quantities, which are components of that input.





    5) For each data quantity, its value must be within limits set by
       the user for it to be valid.





    6) An input data point of a data quantity input is a valid data
       point, if every quantity for that input data point is valid.



       An input data point of a data quantity input is an invalid data
       point, if any quantity for that input data point is invalid.





    7) The user can choose the procedure to set the time tags for the
       quality flags, from among the following:



            1) Add to the time tag of each data point of the timing
               input a fixed offset.



            2) Add to the time tag of each data point of the timing
               input a fixed fraction of the time interval to the next
               data point of the timing input.





    8) If there is an input data point for the timing input, preceded by
       another point and followed by another point; such that the
       intervals between this point and each of the other two are both
       within the limits prescribed by the user; then we can define a
       time interval for the quality flag for this point.



       First, we determine the time tag for the quality flag for this
       point, as indicated above; and we determine the time tags for the
       quality flag for the preceding point and for the following point.



       Then the time interval that corresponds to this point, for
       determining the quality flag, begins at the mid-point between the
       time tag for the quality flag for this point and the time tag for
       the quality flag for the previous point, and ends at the
       mid-point between the time tag for the quality flag for this
       point and the time tag for the quality flag for the next point.



       Note that a time tag for a quality flag will not necessarily be
       the mid-point of the interval associated with it.





    9) Once a time interval for a quality flag time tag has been
       determined, we must count the number of invalid data points for
       the data quantity inputs, within the time interval.



       At the user's choice, an invalid data point can be counted in any
       one of the following ways:


        1) An invalid data point for an input counts as 1, even if it
           contains more than 1 invalid quantity.


        2) An invalid data point for an input counts as the number of
           invalid quantities it contains.


        3) An invalid data point for an input counts as the total number
           of quantities it contains (valid and invalid).



       The resulting count is the total number of invalid data points
       within the interval, from all the data quantity inputs.



       Although the count is referred to as the number of invalid data
       points, of course it could be larger, if the choice is made to
       count each invalid data point multiple times, according to one of
       the methods listed above.





   10) An output data point is produced for each data point of the
       timing input.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as the time
       tag for the quality flag, that is set for the corresponding
       timing input data point.



       For an output data point to be produced, there must be a time
       interval associated with the time tag, as defined above.





   11) The output data value is a quality flag.



       The quality flag is "good" if the total number of invalid data
       points for the data quantity inputs is less than or equal to a
       maximum chosen by the user.



       The quality flag is "bad" if the total number of invalid data
       points for the data quantity inputs is greater than the maximum
       chosen by the user.



       The values for "good" and "bad" (e.g., 0 and 1) are chosen by the
       user.
