   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module produces the product of a matrix times a
       vector in 3D.



       Optionally, the following is produced in addition:

        1) The magnitude of the resulting vector.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



            1) The input vector.



            2) The matrix.





    3) The output vector is calculated as follows:


           Matrix * [Input vector]





    4) At the user's option, the transpose of the input matrix can be
       used in the calculation instead of the input matrix itself.





    5) An output data point is produced for each input vector.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input vector.





    6) For an output data point to be produced, the input vector must be
       in the time interval defined by two input matrix data points.



       The matrix for the time of the input vector is the input matrix
       at the closest time available.



       However, if the time interval between the two input data points
       for the matrix is larger than a chosen value, this is considered
       to be a data dropout.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0      =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1   =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                              dump frequency); i.e., every n-th point.

                    <= -1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-1)  (where -n is the
                              chosen dump frequency); i.e., the first n
                              points.



            2) Flag to produce the vector magnitude.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    WT_TRUE   =  Produce the magnitude.

                    WT_FALSE  =  Do not produce the magnitude.



            3) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the 3 input vector components.



                1) Input component index.


                   Int.



            4) Flag to transpose the matrix.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    WT_TRUE   =  Transpose.

                    WT_FALSE  =  Do not transpose.



            5) Dropout time for the matrix.


               Double.


               Units are seconds.

               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.
