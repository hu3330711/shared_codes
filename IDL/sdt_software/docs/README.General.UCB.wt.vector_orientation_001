   1. Science Description.





    1) This Science Module determines the orientation of a vector (in
       3D), with respect to the coordinate axes.





    2) There must be the following SDT inputs:



        1) The input vector.


           This gives the vector in Cartesian components.





    3) The vector orientation data consists of the following:



        1) The direction cosines.


           These are the cosines of the angles between the vector and
           each of the positive coordinate axes (in the order: X, Y, Z).



        2) The direction angles.


           These are the angles between the vector and each of the
           positive coordinate axes (in the order: X, Y, Z).


           The direction angles are produced in degrees, from 0 to +180.



        3) Latitude.


           The latitude of the vector is latitude with respect to the
           coordinate X-Y plane.


           The latitude is positive if the vector points to the same
           side of the X-Y plane as the positive Z axis; and
           negative if the vector points to the other side of the X-Y
           plane.


           The latitude is produced in degrees, from -90 to +90.



        4) Longitude.


           The longitude of the vector is longitude on the X-Y plane.


           The longitude is produced in degrees, from -180 to +180.


           The longitude is 0 at the  positive X axis, and changes to
           +90 degrees at the positive Y axis, and on to +180 degrees at
           the negative X axis.

           Going in the other direction, starting from 0 at the positive
           X axis, the longitude changes to -90 degrees at the negative
           Y axis, and on to -180 degrees at the negative X axis.





    4) If the vector magnitude is 0, then the direction cosines, the
       direction angles, the latitude, and the longitude; are all set to
       0.





    6) An output data point is produced for each input data point.



       The time tag for the output data point is the same as that for
       the corresponding input data point.

   2. Usage Description.





    1) This Science Module can operate in Data Analysis mode only.





    2) There must be the following command-line arguments:



           None.





    3) There must be the following user parameters:



            1) Dump frequency for the output data points.


               Int.


               Must be one of the following:


                    0      =  Do not dump.

                    >= 1   =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, n, 2n, 3n, ...  (where n is the chosen
                              dump frequency); i.e., every n-th point.

                    <= -1  =  Dump output data points with indices of:
                              0, 1, 2, 3, ..., (n-1)  (where -n is the
                              chosen dump frequency); i.e., the first n
                              points.



            2) The group of parameters described here occurs once for
               each of the 3 input vector components.



                1) Input component index.


                   Int.





    4) The following input data files are used:



           None.





    5) There must be the following SDT input data quantities:



            1) The input vector.


               This input consists of a time series (Standard data
               type); the following components are required, and must be
               of the indicated types:


                1) Time.

                   Double.

                   Must be component 0.


                2) Additional components for the 3 vector components.

                   Float.





    6) The SDT output data quantity is a time series (Standard data
       type), and consists of the following components:



            1) Time.


               Double.



            2) - 4) Direction cosines.


               Float.



            5) - 7) Direction angles.


               Float.



            8) Latitude.


               Float.



            9) Longitude.


               Float.
